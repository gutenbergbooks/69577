</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>BY MR. DARWIN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The object of the present Introduction, is briefly to describe the principal localities,
from which the Zoological specimens, collected during the voyage of the
Beagle, were obtained. At the conclusion of this work, after each species has
been separately examined and described, it will be more advantageous to incorporate
any general remarks. The Beagle was employed for nearly five years out
of England; of this time a very large proportion was spent in surveying the
coasts of the Southern part of South America, and of the remainder, much was
consumed in making long passages during her circumnavigation of the globe.
Hence nearly the entire collection, especially of the animals belonging to the
higher orders, was procured from this continent; to which, however, must be added
the Galapagos Archipelago, a group of islands in the Pacific, but not far distant
from the American coast. The localities may be briefly described under the
following heads.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Brazil.</span> This country presents an enormous area, supporting the most
luxuriant productions of the intertropical regions. It is composed of primary
formations, and may be considered as being hilly rather than mountainous. <span class='sc'>La
Plata</span> includes the several provinces bordering that great river;—namely,
Buenos Ayres, Banda Oriental, Santa Fé, Entre Rios, &#38;c. My collections were
chiefly made at <span class='sc'>Buenos Ayres</span>, at <span class='sc'>Monte Video</span>, the capital of Banda Oriental,
and at <span class='sc'>Maldonado</span>, a town in the same province, situated on the northern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>shore, near the mouth of the estuary of the Plata. These countries consist
either of an undulating surface, clothed with turf, or of perfectly level plains with
enormous beds of thistles. Except on the banks of the rivers, trees nowhere
grow; there are, however, thickets in some of the valleys, in the more hilly parts of
Banda Oriental. During the winter and spring of this hemisphere, a considerable
quantity of rain falls, and the plains of turf are then everywhere verdant; but in
summer the country assumes a brown and parched appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Bahia Blanca</span> forms a large bay, in latitude 39° S. on a part of the coast,
which falls within the territory of the province of Buenos Ayres, but which from
its physical conditions would more properly be classed with Patagonia. The tertiary
plains of <span class='sc'>Patagonia</span>, extend from the Strait of Magellan to the Rio
Negro, which is commonly assumed as their Northern boundary. This space
of more than seven hundred miles in length, and in breadth reaching from the
Cordillera to the Atlantic Ocean, is everywhere characterised by the dreary
uniformity of its landscape. Nearly desert plains, composed of a thick bed of
shingle, and often strewed over with sea-shells, (plainly indicating that the land
has been covered within a recent period by the sea,) are but rarely interrupted by
hills of porphyry, and other crystalline rocks. The plains support scattered tufts
of wiry grass, and stunted bushes; whilst in the broad flat-bottomed valleys, dwarf
thorn-bearing trees, barely ornamented with the scantiest foliage, sometimes unite
into thickets; and here the few feathered inhabitants of these sterile regions resort.
There is an extreme scarcity of water; and where it is found, especially if in lakes,
it is generally as salt as brine. The sky in summer is cloudless, and the heat
in consequence, considerable; whereas the frosts of winter are, sometimes, severe.
The principal localities visited by the Beagle, were the <span class='sc'>Rio Negro</span>, in latitude
41° S., <span class='sc'>Port Desire</span>, <span class='sc'>Port St. Julian</span>, and <span class='sc'>Santa Cruz</span>. At the latter place, a
party, under the command of Captain FitzRoy, followed up the river in boats, to
within a few miles of the Cordillera; and an opportunity was thus afforded of
verifying the nature of the country in its entire breadth. At the Rio Negro the
plains are much more thickly covered with bushes, (chiefly acacias,) than in any
other part of Patagonia.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Tierra del Fuego</span> may be supposed to include all the broken land south of
a line joining the opposite mouths of the Strait of Magellan. The land is mountainous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>and may be aptly compared to a lofty chain, partly submerged in the
sea;—bays and channels occupying the position of valleys. The Eastern side
almost exclusively consists of clay-slate; the Western, of primary, and various
plutonic formations. The mountains, from the water’s edge, to within a short distance
of the lower limit of perpetual snow, are everywhere (excepting on the exposed
western shores) concealed by an impervious forest, the trees of which do
not periodically shed their leaves. On the East coast, the outline of the land
shows that tertiary formations, like those of Patagonia, extend south of the Strait
of Magellan; but with the exception of this part, it is rare to find even a
small space of level ground; and where such occurs, a thick bed of peat invariably
covers the surface. The climate is of that kind which has been denominated
insular: the winters are far from being excessively cold, whilst the
summers are gloomy, boisterous, and seldom cheered by the rays of the sun.
In all seasons, a large quantity of rain falls. Hence, from the physical conditions
of Tierra del Fuego, all the land animals must live either on the sea-beach, (and in
this class the Aborigines may be included) or within the humid and entangled
forests.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <span class='sc'>Falkland Islands</span> are situated in the same latitude as the Eastern
entrance of the Strait of Magellan, and about 270 miles East of it. The
climate is nearly the same as in Tierra del Fuego, but the surface of the land,
instead of being as there, concealed by one great forest, does not support a single
tree. We see on every side a withered and coarse herbage, with a few low bushes,
which spring from the peaty soil of an undulating moorland. Scattered hills,
and a central range of quartz rock, protrude through formations of clay-slate
and sand-stone (belonging to the Silurian epoch,) which compose the lower
country.</p>

<p class='c007'>The structure of the west coast of South America, from the Strait of Magellan
northward to latitude 38°, in its greater part, (as far north as Chiloe) is
very similar to that of Tierra del Fuego. The climate likewise is similar,—being
gloomy, boisterous, and extremely humid; and, consequently, the land is concealed
by an almost impenetrable forest. In the northern part of this region, the
temperature of course is considerably higher than near the Strait of Magellan;
but nevertheless it is much less so, than might have been anticipated from so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>great a change in latitude. Hence, although the vegetation of this northern
district presents a marked difference when compared with that of the southern;
yet the zoology in many respects has, like the general aspect of the landscape, a
very uniform character. The specimens were chiefly collected from the <span class='sc'>Peninsula
of Tres Montes</span>, the <span class='sc'>Chonos Archipelago</span> (from latitude 46° to 43° 30′),
<span class='sc'>Chiloe</span> with the adjoining islets, and <span class='sc'>Valdivia</span>. The contrast between the
physical conditions and productions of the East and West coasts of this part of
South America is very remarkable. On one side of the Cordillera, great heavy
clouds are driven along by the western gales in unbroken sheets, and the indented
land is clothed with thick forests; whilst on the other side of this great range, a
bright sky, with a clear and dry atmosphere, extends over wide and desolate
plains.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Chile</span> in the neighbourhood of <span class='sc'>Concepcion</span> (latitude 36° 42′ S.) may be called
a fertile land; for it is diversified with fine woods, pasturage, and cultivated
fields. But towards the more central districts (near <span class='sc'>Valparaiso</span> and <span class='sc'>Santiago</span>)
although by the aid of irrigation, the soil in the valleys yields a most abundant
return, yet the appearance of the hills, thinly scattered with various kinds of
bushes and cylindrical Opuntias, bespeaks an arid climate. In winter, rain is
copious, but during a long summer of from six to eight months, a shower never
moistens the parched soil. The country has a very alpine character, and is
traversed by several chains of mountains extending parallel to the Andes. These
ranges include between them level basins, which appear once to have formed the
beds of ancient channels and bays, such as those now intersecting the land
further to the south. North of the neighbourhood of Valparaiso, the climate
rapidly becomes more and more arid, and the land in proportion desert. Beyond
the valley of <span class='sc'>Coquimbo</span> (latitude 30°.) it is scarcely habitable, excepting in the
valleys of Guasco, Copiapó, and Paposa, which owe their entire fertility to the
system of irrigation, invented by the aboriginal Indians and followed by the
Spanish colonists. Northward of these places, the absolute desert of Atacama
forms a complete barrier, and eastward, the snow-clad chain of the Cordillera
separates the Zoological province of Chile, from that of the wide plains which
extend on the other side of the Andes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last district which it is at all necessary for me to mention here, is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>of the <span class='sc'>Galapagos Archipelago</span>, situated under the Equator, and between five
and six hundred miles West of the coast of America. These islands are entirely
volcanic in their composition; and on two of them the volcanic forces have within
late years been seen in activity. There are five principal islands, and several
smaller ones: they cover a space of 2° 10′ in latitude, and 2° 35′ in longitude. The
climate, for an equatorial region, is far from being excessively hot: it is extremely
dry; and although the sky is often clouded, rain seldom falls, excepting during
one short season, and then its quantity is variable. Hence, in the lower part
of these islands, even the more ancient streams of lava (the recent ones
still remaining naked and glossy) are clothed only with thin and nearly leafless
bushes. At an elevation of 1200 feet, and upwards, the land receives the moisture
condensed from the clouds, which are drifted by the trade wind over this part
of the ocean at an inconsiderable height. In consequence of this, the upper
and central part of each island supports a green and thriving vegetation; but
from some cause, not very easily explained, it is much less frequented, than
the lower and rocky districts are, by the feathered inhabitants of this archipelago.</p>

<p class='c007'>By a reference to the localities here described, it is hoped that the reader
will obtain some general idea of the nature of the different countries inhabited
by the several animals, which will be described in the following sheets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vertebrate animals in my collection have been presented to the following
museums:—the Mammalia and Birds to the Zoological Society; the Fishes to
the Cambridge Philosophical Society; and the Reptiles, when described, will be
deposited in the British Museum. For the care and preservation of all these and
other specimens, during the long interval of time between their arrival in this
country and my return, I am deeply indebted to the kindness of the Rev. Professor
Henslow of Cambridge. With respect to the gentlemen, who have undertaken
the several departments of this publication, I hope they will permit me
here to express the great personal obligation which I feel towards them, and
likewise my admiration at the disinterested zeal which has induced them thus to
bestow their time and talents for the good of Science.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description.</span>—The fur of this Bat is glossy and has a silk-like appearance; that
on the top of the head, sides of the face, and the whole of the upper parts of
the body, is of a deep brown colour; all the hairs on these parts, however,
are white at the base. The flanks, interfemoral membrane, and the arms, are
also covered on their upper side with brown hairs. On the lower part of the
sides of the face, and the whole of the under parts of the body, the hairs are
of an ashy-white colour. The membrane of the wing is brownish. The
ears are of moderate size, and somewhat pointed; externally they are
covered with minute brown hairs, and internally with white. The tragus is
also covered with white hairs; it is of a narrow form, pointed at the tip,
and has a small acute process in the middle of the outer margin. The nose-leaf
is pierced by the nostrils, which diverge posteriorly, and is so deeply
cleft on its hinder margin, that it may be compared to two small leaflets
joined side by side near their bases. These leaflets, unlike the nose-leaf
of the Phyllostomina, lie horizontally on the nose to which they are attached
throughout, a slight ridge only indicating their margin. Around the posterior
part of the nose-leaf there is a considerable naked space, in which
two small hollows are observable, situated one on each side, and close to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>nose-leaf; and, at a short distance behind the nose-leaf, this naked membrane
is slightly elevated, and forms a transverse fleshy tubercle.</p>

species, “is often the cause of much trouble, by biting the horses on their
withers. The injury is generally not so much owing to the loss of blood, as to
the inflammation which the pressure of the saddle afterwards produces. The
whole circumstance has lately been doubted in England; I was therefore fortunate
in being present when one was actually caught on a horse’s back. We
were bivouacking late one evening near Coquimbo, in Chile, when my servant,
noticing that one of the horses was very restive, went to see what was the matter,
and fancying he could distinguish something, suddenly put his hand on the beast’s
withers, and secured the Vampire. In the morning, the spot where the bite had
been inflicted was easily distinguished from being slightly swollen and bloody.
The third day afterwards we rode the horse, without any ill effects.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the introduction of the domesticated quadrupeds, this Vampire Bat
probably preyed on the guanaco, or vicugna, for these, together with the puma,
and man, were the only terrestrial mammalia of large size, which formerly inhabited
the northern part of Chile. This species must be unknown, or very uncommon in
Central Chile, since Molina, who lived in that part, says (Compendio de la Historia
del Reyno de Chile, vol. i. p. 301,) “that no blood-sucking species is found
in this province.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to find that the structure of this animal is in perfect accordance
with the habits as above detailed by Mr. Darwin. Among other points, the
total absence of true molars, and consequent want of the power of masticating
food, is the most remarkable. On the other hand we find the canines and incisors
perfectly fitted for inflicting a wound such as described, while the small
size of the interfemoral membrane (giving freedom to the motions of the legs,)
together with the unusually large size of the thumb and claw, would enable
this Bat, as I should imagine, to fix itself with great security to the body of the
horse.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have named this species after M. d’Orbigny, who has added so much to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>our information on the zoological productions of South America. The <i>Edostoma
cinerea</i><a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of that author has evidently a close affinity to the animal here
described, and differs chiefly (judging from the drawing published in his work)
in the larger size of the ears, in having the nose-leaf free, and the surrounding
membrane free and elevated.</p>

<p class='c007'>As M. d’Orbigny has not yet published the character of his genus <i>Edostoma</i>,
his figure is my only guide, and in this figure I find the dentition agreeing both
with that of the present species, and that of the genus <i>Desmodus</i> of Prince
Maximilian,—as would appear from the published descriptions, and figure
given by M. de Blainville<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.—The points of distinction between M. d’Orbigny’s
animal and the species here described, are not, in my opinion, of sufficient
importance to constitute generic characters, I have, therefore, retained the name
of Desmodus.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is desireable perhaps to separate the Blood-sucking Bats from the Insectivorous
species, and place them between the latter group and the <i>Pteropina</i>,
(with which they agree in the large size of the thumb and the rudimentary
interfemoral membrane,) under a sectional name, which I propose to call <i>Hæmatophilini</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Phyllostoma Grayi.</span><br> <span class='small'><span class='sc'>Plate II.</span></span></h3>

<p class='c014'><i>P. fusco-cinereum; nasûs prosthemate lanceolato; auribus mediocribus, trago basin
versus extùs unidentato; caudâ gracillimâ, brevi, et membranâ interfemorali inclusâ;
verrucâ complanatâ ad apicem menti, verrucis parvulis circumdatâ.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description.</span>—This Phyllostoma agrees with the species described by Mr. J.
Gray<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a> under the name of Childreni, in having on the lower lip “an half
ovate group of crowded warts,” but is of a much smaller size, and differs
also in colour.</p>

<p class='c015'>The number of teeth are as follows:—incisors ⁴⁄₄; canines ²⁄₂; molars 5⁵⁄₅–5 = 32.
The intermediate pair of incisors of the upper jaw are large, compressed, and
have their apices rounded; the lateral pair are so minute, that they are
scarcely visible without the assistance of a lens: the four incisors of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>lower jaw, are somewhat crowded, the intermediate pair are slightly larger
than the lateral; they are all deeply notched, and broad at the apex. The
cerebral portion of the skull is much arched and the anterior portion is depressed.
The zygomatic arch is imperfect; see Pl. 35. figs. 2. The nose-leaf
is lanceolate, and of moderate size: the ears are also of moderate size;
they are rounded at the tip and emarginated on their exterior edge: the
tragus is elongated, and suddenly attenuated towards the apex; the outer
margin is deeply notched towards the base, and very obscurely crenulated
above this notch. The interfemoral membrane is of moderate extent, and
emarginated posteriorly. The tail, which is very slender, is entirely enclosed
by the interfemoral membrane, and the visible portion appears to consist of
but two joints, which together, measure about two and a half lines in length.
The basal half of the thumb is enclosed in membrane. The fur is soft and
rather long. The general tint of the upper and under parts of the body is
brownish-ash; the hairs on the neck and on the whole of the back are grey
at the base, then white, or nearly so, brownish-ash near the tip, and whitish
at the tip. On the belly the hairs are nearly of an uniform brown-ash colour,
their apices only being whitish. The ears, nose-leaf, and membrane of the
wings, are of a sooty-black hue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Pernambuco, Brazil. (<i>August.</i>)</p>

<p class='c006'>“This species appeared to be common at Pernambuco (five degrees north of
Bahia). Upon entering an old lime-kiln in the middle of the day, I disturbed a
considerable number of them: they did not seem to be much incommoded by the
light, and their habitation was much less dark than that usually frequented as a
sleeping place by these animals.” D.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have named this species after Mr. John Gray, the author of several extensive
memoirs on the order to which it belongs, and to whom I am indebted for
valuable assistance whilst comparing this and other species with those contained
in the collection of the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description.</span>—In size and colouring, this Bat very closely resembles the <i>Vespertilio
Pipistrellus</i> of Europe; the wings, however, are considerably broader
in proportion; the antibrachium, tibia, and tail, are each of them longer; the
tragus of the ear is also longer, and narrower.</p>

<p class='c015'>The muzzle is short and obtuse, and furnished on each side with numerous
hairs, which, when compared with those of other parts, are of a more harsh
nature. The nose is naked at the apex. The forehead is concave. The
ears are narrow, and somewhat pointed, emarginated externally, and have
about four transverse rugæ: the tragus is elongated, narrow, and pointed, and
has the outer margin very obscurely crenulated. On the chin there is a
small wart, from which spring several stiffish hairs. The tail is about equal
to the body in length, and has the extreme tip free. The fur is moderately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>long, and of an uniform rich brown colour, and extends on to the base of the
interfemoral membrane above and below; the remainder of this membrane is
bare, and, together with that of the wings, of a black colour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of this species I find three specimens in Mr. Darwin’s collection—“It is remarkable,”
says Mr. Darwin, “for its wide geographical range. I obtained
specimens at Maldonado, on the northern bank of the Plata, where it was exceedingly
numerous in the attics of old houses, and likewise at Valparaiso in
Chile. Molina (vol. i. p. 301.) says another species is found in Chile, of the

<p class='c007'>Upon comparing the dimensions of several specimens of this species with
those given by Temminck in his “Monographie sur le Genre Molosse,” I find
that they vary very considerably; I shall therefore be adding some little to the
history of the species, by giving the dimensions of those now before me, together
with the sexes of the specimens measured, and their localities. In all these
specimens there is a series of pointed tubercles along the upper margin of the
ears, a character which M. Temminck has omitted to notice. They vary slightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>in the intensity of their colouring, but among those brought from Chile I do not
perceive any agreeing with that species, or variety, mentioned by Molina as
approaching to an orange colour. All the specimens whose dimensions are here
given, are preserved in spirit. Two of them are from Maldonado brought by
Mr. Darwin; three were collected in Hayti by Mr. J. Hearne, and one is from
Chile, whence it was brought by Mr. H. Cuming.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description</span>.—This animal is considerably larger than the common fox, (<i>Canis
Vulpes</i>, Auct.) and stouter in its proportions, and, in fact, appears to be
intermediate between the ordinary foxes and the wolves. The tail is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>smaller and less bushy than in the former animals. The contour of the head
is wolf-like; the legs, however, are shorter than in the true wolves; and the
tail is white at the apex, a character common in the foxes.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fur of the Antarctic Fox is moderately long, and the under fur is not
very abundant, especially as compared with that of the C. <i>magellanicus</i>. This
under fur is of a pale brown colour; the apical portion of each hair is yellowish;
the longer hairs are black at the apex, brown at the base, and annulated
with white towards the apex. In many of these hairs the subapical pale ring
is wanting. On the chest and belly the hairs are of a pale dirty yellow
colour, gray-white at the base, and black at the apex. On the hinder part
of the belly the hairs are almost of an uniform dirty white. The space around
the angle of the mouth, the upper lip, and the whole of the throat, are white.
The chin is brown-white, or brownish. The basal half of the tail is of the
same colour as the body, and the hairs are of the same texture; on the apical
half of the tail they are of a harsher or less woolly nature, of a black colour
at the apex, and brownish at the base; those at the extreme point are totally
white. The legs are almost of an uniform fulvous colour; the feet are of a
somewhat paler hue; the hairs on the under side of the hinder feet are
brownish, and the external and posterior parts of the tibiæ are suffused with
the same tint. The hairs on the head are grizzled with black and fulvous;
the former of these colours is somewhat conspicuous, excepting in the region
of the eyes, where the fulvous or yellowish tint prevails. The muzzle is
scarcely of so dark a hue as the crown of the head. The ears are furnished
internally with long white hairs, externally the hairs are yellowish, with their
apices black; the latter colour is more conspicuous towards the tip of the ear.
The sides of the neck near the ear are of a rich fulvous hue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Falkland Islands.</p>

<p class='c006'>Three specimens of this animal were brought to England by Capt. FitzRoy;
from one of which, the above drawing and description has been made. The
earliest notice I can find of this animal is by Pernety,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> during Bougainville’s voyage,
which was undertaken in 1764, for the purpose of colonizing these islands.
The strange familiarity of its manner seems to have excited the fears of some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the seamen in Commodore Byron’s voyage (in 1765) in rather a ludicrous manner.
Byron says that seals were not the only dangerous animals that they found, “for
the master having been sent out one day to sound the coast upon the south shore,
reported at his return that four creatures of great fierceness, resembling wolves,
ran up to their bellies in the water to attack the people in his boat, and that as
they happened to have no fire-arms with them, they had immediately put the boat
off in deep water.” Byron adds that, “When any of these creatures got sight of
our people, though at ever so great a distance, they ran directly at them; and no
less than five of them were killed this day. They were always called wolves by
the ship’s company, but, except in their size, and the shape of the tail, I think
they bore a greater resemblance to a fox. They are as big as a middle-sized mastiff,
and their fangs are remarkably long and sharp. There are great numbers of
them upon this coast, though it is not perhaps easy to guess how they first came
hither; for these islands are at least one hundred leagues distant from the main.
They burrow in the ground like a fox, and we have frequently seen pieces of seals
which they have mangled, and the skins of penguins lie scattered about the
mouths of their holes. To get rid of these creatures, our people set fire to the
grass, so that the country was in a blaze as far as the eye could reach, for
several days, and we could see them running in great numbers to seek other
quarters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The habits of these animals remain nearly the same to the present day, although
their numbers have been greatly decreased by the singular facility with which they
are destroyed. I was assured by several of the Spanish countrymen, who are employed
in hunting the cattle which have run wild on these islands, that they have
repeatedly killed them by means of a knife held in one hand, and a piece of meat
to tempt them to approach, in the other. They range over the whole island, but
perhaps are most numerous near the coast; in the inland parts they must subsist
almost exclusively on the upland geese, (<i>Anser leucopterus</i>,) which, from fear of
them, like the eider-ducks of Iceland, build only on the small outlying islets.
These wolves do not go in packs; they wander about by day, but more commonly
in the evening; they burrow holes; are generally very silent, excepting during the
breeding season, when they utter cries, which were described to me as resembling
those of the <i>Canis Azaræ</i>. Spaniards and half-caste Indians, from several districts
of the southern portions of South America, have visited these islands, and they all
declare that the wolf is not found on the mainland; the sealers likewise say it does
not occur on Georgia, Sandwich Land, or the other islands in the Antarctic ocean.
I entertain, therefore, no doubt, that the <i>Canis antarcticus</i> is peculiar to this
archipelago. It is found both on East and West Falkland, as might have been
inferred from the accounts given by Bougainville and Byron, who visited different
islands;—I state this particularly, because the contrary has been asserted. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>assured by Mr. Low, an intelligent sealer, who has long frequented these islands,
that the wolves of West Falkland are invariably smaller and of a redder colour
than those from the Eastern island; and this account was corroborated by the
officers of the Adventure, employed in surveying the archipelago. Mr. Gray, of
the British Museum, had the kindness to compare in my presence the specimens
deposited there by Captain Fitzroy, but he could not detect any essential
difference between them. The number of these animals during the last fifty
years must have been greatly reduced; already they are entirely banished from
that half of East Falkland which lies East of the head of St. Salvador Bay and
Berkeley Sound; and it cannot, I think, be doubted, that as these islands are
now becoming colonized, before the paper is decayed on which this animal has
been figured, it will be ranked amongst those species which have perished from
the face of the earth.”—D.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description.</span>—This species is considerably larger than the European fox; its
form is more bulky, the limbs are shorter and stouter in proportion, the ears
are smaller and the tail is more bushy. The fur is long, thick, and loose.
The under fur is very long, abundant, and of a woolly texture. The back is
mottled with black and white, the former of these colours being predominant;
the hairs on this part are gray at the base, there is then a considerable space
of a pale, or whitish brown colour; next follows a broad white ring, beyond
which the hairs are black. On the sides of the body the hairs are coloured
in the same way, excepting that the white portion is more extended, and is
followed by a rich yellow-brown, shaded into black as it approaches the apex
of each hair. Hence the general hue of the sides of the body is paler than
that of the back, the brown and white tints being the more conspicuous.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The hairs of the head are annulated with white, and fulvous, and are black at
the tip; the two former colours are most conspicuous. The chin is brownish.
The lower part of the cheeks, the throat, and the under parts of the body, are
of a dirty yellowish white colour, inclining to buff in certain parts, especially
on the lower part of the neck and chest. The limbs are of a rich deep fulvous,
or yellowish rust colour externally; the feet and inner sides of the legs are of
a paler hue. On the hinder legs externally, above the heel, is a patch of
bright rust colour; such is also the colour of the ears externally, and likewise
of that portion of the neck behind the ears. Internally the ears are furnished
with long yellowish white hairs. The tail is long and very bushy; at its
base the hairs are rusty white, towards the middle they are of a paleish rust
colour, and at the apex they are black; there is also a black patch on the
upper part towards the base. The hairs of the tail beneath are almost entirely
of an uniform rusty white colour, those on the upper side are all tipped with
black.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Chile. (<i>June.</i>)</p>

<p class='c006'>“This animal was first brought to Europe by Captain Philip P. King, who
obtained it at Port Famine in Tierra del Fuego, where it is common. My specimen
was obtained in the valley of Copiapó in the northern part of Chile. The Magellanic
fox, therefore, has a range on the western coast of at least 1600 miles,
from the humid and entangled forests of Tierra del Fuego, to the almost absolutely
desert country of northern Chile. In La Plata, on the Atlantic side of the continent,
I believe it is not found.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> It is mentioned by Molina in his account of the
animals of Chile,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a> under the name of Culpeu, which he supposes to be derived from
the Indian word “culpem,” signifying madness; for this animal, when it sees a
man, runs towards him, and standing at the distance of a few yards, looks at him
attentively. He adds, although great numbers are killed, they do not leave off
this habit. Molina states that he has repeatedly been a witness of this, and I
received nearly similar accounts from several of the inhabitants of Chile: yet I
must observe, that the people of the farm-house, where my specimen was killed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>(after it, together with its female, had destroyed nearly two hundred fowls) bitterly
complained of its craftiness. From this bold curiosity in the disposition of the
Culpeu, Molina thought that it was the same animal as that described by Byron
at the Falkland Islands, but we now know that they are different. The Culpeu
burrows holes under ground, often wanders about by day, is very strong and fleet.
When riding one day in the valley of Copiapó, accompanied by a half-bred greyhound,
I happened to come across one of these foxes; and although the ground
was, in the first part of the chase, level, it soon entirely distanced its pursuer.
Whilst running, it barked so like a dog, that until it had run some way a-head of
the greyhound, I could not tell from which animal the noise proceeded. After the
Culpeu had reached the mountains, it made a sudden bend from its course, and
returned in a nearly parallel line, but at the base of a steep cliff of rock; it
then quietly seated itself on its haunches, and seemed to listen with much satisfaction
to the dog, which was running the scent on the mountain side, above its
head.”—D.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description.</span>—This species is considerably less than the common European fox,
(<i>Canis Vulpes</i>, Auct.) its weight probably would scarcely exceed half that of
the latter animal. The form of the body is stout, the limbs are short and
rather slender; the head is also short, and the muzzle is pointed; the ears are
of moderate size. The tail is about equal to half the whole length of the
body, head included; and compared with that of ordinary foxes, is much less
bushy, especially at the base. The general hue of this animal is very dark;
the fur is rather short, and harsh to the touch; the under fur is abundant, and
of a woolly texture. On the back, all the hairs are of a deep brown colour,
annulated with white near the apex, and black at the apex. When the fur is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>in its ordinary position, the brown colour is not seen, and the black and
white produce a grizzled appearance; the black colour, however, predominates.
On the sides of the body each hair is grayish at the base, then
pale brown, near the apex annulated with white, and at the apex black: the
three last mentioned colours are exhibited in about equal proportions (the fur
being in its natural position) over the haunches and shoulders, but between
these two parts, the brown and white colours are the more conspicuous. The
hairs of the head are coloured in the same way as those of the sides of the
body, excepting that the brown portion of each hair, is replaced by rusty
brown, which gives a rufous hue to this part. The muzzle and chin are of a
sooty brown colour. A dirty white patch is observable on each side of the
muzzle at the apex, and this colour is extended along the margin of the upper
lip on to the lower part of the cheeks, and over the whole of the throat; all
the hairs in these parts (with the exception of those on the lips) being of a
deep brownish gray colour, with their apical portions only, white. The ears
are covered internally with long yellowish white hairs; towards, and on the
margin of the ears externally, the hairs are of a buff colour, on the remaining
portion of the ears, and on the sides of the neck, they are of a reddish chestnut
hue. The hairs of the under parts of the body are brown, those near the
hinder legs, and between them, are of a dirty white colour at the apex;
towards the rump they are of a yellowish brown colour. The hairs of the
tail are brown, black at the apex, and annulated with white near the apex;
on the apical portion the hairs are black, and brown at the base. The fore
legs are of a brown colour externally, internally they are of a brownish
fulvous hue; such is also the colour of the feet. The fore part of the posterior
legs is whitish, and there is a large blackish patch on the outer side, and
extending around the posterior part, above the heel.</p>

<p class='c006'>The black and white portions of the hairs on the back produce in that part a
mottled appearance, and in the specimen from which the above description is
taken, these two colours are about equal in proportion. In another specimen now
before me, the black colour predominates on the back. The fur in the younger
animals of this species is not so long nor so harsh, and the upper parts are grizzled
with black and white; that is to say, these two colours do not form patches of
considerable extent as in the adults; the general colouring is also somewhat paler.
The chin is brown-black or brown, instead of black, and the upper band, or that,
which in the adult extends across the upper part of the neck, is interrupted in the
middle; in fact, is only traceable on the <i>sides</i> of the neck.</p>

<p class='c007'>Azara, in his description of the Agouarachay, says, the muzzle, as far back
as the eyes, is blackish; whereas, in all the specimens examined by me, the
muzzle is of the same colour as the other parts of the head, or <i>very</i> nearly so. In
other respects his description agrees with the animal described by me, and <i>not</i>
with the <i>Canis cinereo-argentatus</i>, which Desmarest and Lesson suppose to be the
Agouarachay of Azara. In Fischer’s “<i>Synopsis Mammalium</i>” the <i>Canis Azaræ</i> is
described as having the tip of the tail white; whereas it is black, not only in the
five specimens which have come under my notice, but also in those in the collection
of Prince Maximilian<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> (who was the original describer) and in the Paris
Museum.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This animal has a wide range; Prince Maximilian brought specimens from
Brazil; and it is common in La Plata, Chile, the whole of Patagonia, even to the
shores of the Strait of Magellan; and a fox, which lives on the small islands not
far from Cape Horn, probably belongs to this species. This animal generally
frequents desert places; I saw many in the valley of the Despoblado, a branch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>that of Copiapó, where there is no fresh water, and where, with the exception of
some small rodents, (the constant inhabitants of sterile regions) scarcely any
other animal could exist. I saw also very many of these foxes wandering about
by day (although Azara says they are nocturnal in Paraguay) on the plains of
Santa Cruz, where various kinds of mice are abundant, and likewise around the
Sierra Ventana. In the course of one day’s ride in this latter neighbourhood, (not
far from Bahia Blanca, lat. 39° S.) I should think I saw between thirty and forty.
They generally were wandering at no great distance from their burrows; but, as
they are not very swift animals, our dogs caught two. Azara states that in Paraguay
this fox, which he calls the Agourá-chay, inhabits thick woods, and that it
makes a great nest or pile of straw, to lie on; but that near Buenos Ayres it uses
the holes of the Bizcacha. Further southward, where the Bizcacha is not found, it
certainly excavates its own burrow.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> In Chile these foxes are very destructive
to the vineyards, from the quantity of grapes they consume; so that boys
are generally kept in the vintage season with bells and other means to frighten
them away. Azara states, that in Paraguay they likewise eat fruit and sugarcane.
By the same authority it is said, that the Agourá-chay, when taken
young, is easily domesticated.”—D.</p>

under fur is of a pale grayish brown colour; the hairs which constitute the
chief clothing of the animal, are black, annulated with brownish yellow, or
in some parts, yellow-white, each hair having about three or four rings. The
black and pale colours are about equal in proportion, and their mixture produces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>a deep brown tint, which is almost uniform throughout the body
and limbs. On the head the yellowish colour predominates over the black,
excepting on the tip of the muzzle, and thence back to the eye, where the
hairs are of a brownish black colour. On the throat the hairs are brown. The
underside of the tarsus is black, and on the outer side of the fore foot there
is a black mark which extends upwards on to the wrist. The tail is long and
bushy; towards and on the base, the hairs are annulated with black and
yellow, like those of the body; but beyond this they are of a more uniform
colour, each hair being brown at the base, and gradually shaded into black
towards the tip. The ears are small and rounded, and covered with hairs
of the same colour as those on the head. The claws are of a large size, and
white colour; the toes are united for a considerable portion of their length
by the interdigital membrane.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. (<i>May.</i>)</p>

<p class='c006'>“This cat was given me by an old Portuguese priest, who had hunted it down
in a thick forest with a small pack of dogs, after a severe chase. It was killed
near the Gavia mountain, at the distance of a few miles only from Rio de
Janeiro, where it was considered uncommon.” D. Although small, compared
with the Puma, (<i>Felis concolor</i>, Auct.), this cat, in its slender lengthened body,
small head, long tail, and stout limbs, decidedly evinces an affinity to that species.
According to the dimensions of the Yagouaroundi given by Azara, Desmarest, and
Temminck, it appears that the tail is considerably shorter in proportion in the
specimens examined by those naturalists, than in the present individual, and the
difference was such, as to induce Mr. Martin to believe that the latter was a
distinct species; he accordingly proposed for it the specific name of <i>Darwinii</i>. At
the time that Mr. Martin described the specimen alluded to, I was also inclined
to believe it was a distinct species. I mention this because I am afraid my
opinion had a slight share in influencing Mr. Martin’s determination. I have
since seen many specimens, and upon comparing their dimensions, I find that the
proportionate length of the tail varies more than is usual in other species of cats,
and that the difference in the length in this member is not combined with any
other distinguishing character. In colouring there is also a considerable variation,
some specimens being almost black, and having the hairs but obscurely
annulated with white; in others, the hairs are more distinctly annulated, and
the head assumes a grayish hue. Others again, are brown, or black brown,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>having the hairs annulated with yellow. The following are the dimensions of
two specimens in the Paris museum, and those given by the authors above
alluded to.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description.</span>—The Pampas cat is about equal in size to the common wild cat of
Europe (<i>Felis Catus</i>, Linn.). It is however of a stouter form than that animal,
the head is smaller, and the tail is shorter.</p>

<p class='c015'>The most remarkable character in this species consists in the great
length of the fur,—the longer hairs on the back measuring upwards of
three inches, and those on the hinder part of the back, are from four and
a half, to four and three quarter inches in length. The general colour of the
fur is pale yellow-gray. Numerous irregular yellow, or sometimes brown
stripes run in an oblique manner from the back along the sides of the body.
On each side of the face there are two stripes of a yellowish or cinnamon
colour: these stripes commence near the eye, extend backwards and downwards
over the cheeks, on the hinder part of which they join and form a single
line, which encircles the lower part of the throat. The tip of the muzzle and
the chin are white, and there is a spot in front of the eye, and a line beneath
the eye, of the same colour: the belly and the inner side and hinder part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the fore legs are also white. An irregular black line runs across the lower
part of the chest and extends over the base of the fore legs externally, and
above this line there are two other transverse dark markings on the chest,
which are more or less defined. On the fore legs there are three broad black
bands, two of which encircle the leg, and on the posterior legs there are about
five black bands externally, and some irregular dark spots internally. The feet
are yellowish, and the underside of the tarsus is of a slightly deeper hue.
On the belly there are numerous large irregular black spots. The ears are
of moderate size, furnished internally with long white hairs; externally, the
ears are of the same colour as the head, excepting at the apex where the
hairs are black and form a slight tuft. The tail is short, somewhat bushy, and
devoid of dark rings or spots—the hairs are in fact coloured as those of the
back of the animal. On the upper part of the body each hair is brown at
the base, then yellow, and at the apex, black. On the hinder part of the
back the hairs are almost black at the base, and on the sides of the body
each hair is gray at the base; there is then a considerable space of yellowish white
colour; towards the apex they are white, and at the apex black. The
greater number of the hairs of the moustaches are white.</p>

<p class='c006'>The markings in this animal vary slightly in intensity; those on the body
are generally indistinct, but the black rings on the legs are always very conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This animal takes its name from ‘paja,’ the Spanish word for straw, from
its habit of frequenting reeds. It is common over the whole of the great plains,
which compose the eastern side of the southern part of America. According to
Azara, it extends northward as far as latitude 30°, and to the south, I have reason
to believe, from the accounts I have received, that it is found near the Strait of
Magellan, which would give it a range of nearly 1400 miles, in a north and south
line. One of my specimens was obtained, in 50° south, at Santa Cruz: it was
met with in a valley, where a few thickets were growing. When disturbed, it did
not run away, but drew itself up, and hissed. My other specimen was half-grown,
and was killed in the end of August, at Bahia Blanca.”—D.</p>

<p class='c007'>I find in Mr. Darwin’s collection a cat, the colouring and proportions of
which, convince me that its origin is from the domestic cat, as however it was
shot in a wild state far from any house, a description may, perhaps, prove useful.
Its general colour is deep gray, and the body is adorned with numerous irregular
narrow black bands; there is a broad black mark, formed of confluent spots,
along the middle of the back, which commences a little behind the shoulders;
a considerable space around the angles of the mouth, the chin, throat, central
portion of the chest, fore feet, toes of the hinder feet, and the posterior portion
of the belly, are white; a black line extends backwards from the posterior angle
of the eye, on to the cheeks; thence, across the throat, there are two lines:
the space between the eye is chiefly occupied with white hairs: the tail is
slender, and tapers towards the apex; the basal half is gray with black rings,
and the apical half is black, excepting the extreme point, which is white: the
tarsus is black beneath: the legs are of a deep gray colour, banded with black
externally.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the dimensions I will add those of a domestic cat which in colour and
markings very closely resembles the animal above described. I may add that
I have chosen a cat rather above the ordinary size for my comparison, yet it
will be seen that the wild cat has the advantage in bulk.</p>

deeper externally. The tint of the under parts of the body is paler than the
upper, and may be described as brown, that of the throat, sides and under
part of the neck, pale brown; and, on the tip of the muzzle and chin, dirty
yellowish white. The hairs of the moustaches are brownish-white; the ears
are covered with short deep brown hairs, those towards the tip are paler.
The hairs covering the feet above are short, and of a very deep brown colour.
The tail is tolerably long, thick at the base, whence it gradually tapers to the
apex. The hairs on the base of the tail resemble those of the body, but on
the remaining portion, they are short, glossy, and very closely applied to the
skin both on the upper and under surface, whereas those on the sides are
longer, and form a kind of fringe. The tip of the muzzle and the soles of
the feet are naked, with the exception of the hinder half of the tarsus.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The La Plata Otter in its general colouring is of a somewhat deeper hue than
the European species, the cheeks and throat instead of being nearly white are of
a pale brown colour; the tail is longer in proportion, and tapers more gradually;
the tip of the muzzle is naked, but the hairless portion is less than in that species,
the boundary line between the naked part and the hair of the top of the muzzle
forming almost a semicircle; the retiring extremities of this line touch the posterior
angle of the nostril on each side, whereas in the common otter the boundary
line of the hair of the muzzle is of a ｗ-like form. The skull is figured in Plate
35, figs. 4, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, and is compared with that of <i>L. Chilensis</i> in the next
description.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This specimen was killed by some fishermen a few miles from Maldonado,
near the mouth of the estuary of the Plata, where the water is quite salt. I am
not, however, by any means sure that it may not be a fresh-water species, which
had wandered from its proper station; in the same manner as not unfrequently
is the case with the <i>Hydrochærus Capybara</i>. I am indebted to Mr. Chaffers,
the master of the Beagle, for having kindly presented me with this specimen.”—D.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>Description.</span>—This species scarcely equals a full grown European otter in size.
It is of a brown colour throughout; the cheeks, chin, and throat, being
slightly paler, and the feet of a deeper tint, than the other parts. The fur
is moderately long, rather harsh to the touch, and semi-erect: the under fur
is abundant, and of a soft and silk nature. The hairs of the ordinary fur
are deep brown, but tipped with a very pale brown colour. The hairs of the
tail, like those of the body, are harsh and semi-erect; towards the apex,
those on the upper and under part are in a slight degree shorter than those
at the sides, and lie closer to the skin; these differences, however, are not
very apparent on the upper side, though distinct on the under. The feet
are naked beneath, with the exception of the posterior half of the tarsus.
The hair of the muzzle extends only down to the posterior angle of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>nostrils, where it terminates in a straight line, leaving the tip of the muzzle
naked.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Chonos Archipelago, (<i>January.</i>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chile Otter was originally described by Mr. Bennett from a specimen
presented to the Zoological Society by Mr. Cuming, but as this specimen is a
young animal, scarcely half-grown, it does not present some of the characters of
the species in so marked a manner as the adult. I have, therefore, availed myself
of an adult specimen in Mr. Darwin’s collection, to draw up the above description.</p>

<p class='c007'>Compared with the Common Otter (<i>Lutra vulgaris</i>, Auct.) the most striking
difference consists in the character of the fur: the hairs instead of being adpressed
as in that species, are here semi-erect, and appear as if they had been
clipped at the extremity. The fur is of a deeper colour, but has a slightly grizzled
appearance, owing to the tip of each hair being of a much paler colour than the
remaining part.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the young animal described by Mr. Bennett, (which in weight was probably
not more than one-third of that of the present animal) the hairs of the body
are of an uniform deep brown colour; hence, if I am right in considering Mr.
Darwin’s animal as the same species, it would appear that the grizzled character
of the fur is dependent on age.</p>

<p class='c007'>The semi-erect fur will also serve to distinguish the present species from the
<i>Lutra Platensis</i>; the fur is likewise longer, the tail is shorter, and the feet are
smaller in proportion. The most important distinctions, however, are furnished
by the skulls; I will, therefore, compare them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skull of <i>L. Chilensis</i> compared with that of <i>L. Platensis</i>, (Plate 35,
figs. 4.) when viewed from above, presents but little difference in general form; it
is, however, smaller in all its proportions, and the zygomatic arch is a little less
convex: the palate is proportionately shorter; the tympanic bullæ are much
smaller, less elevated, and wider apart, in which respect there is a greater approximation
to the skull of <i>L. vulgaris</i> than to that of <i>L. Platensis</i>; but here, the
tympanic bullæ are larger than in <i>L. Chilensis</i>. Both in <i>L. Chilensis</i> and <i>Platensis</i>,
the sub-orbital foramina are kidney-shaped, the emarginated portion being
downwards, whilst in <i>L. vulgaris</i> they approach somewhat to a triangular figure,
the apex being external. In <i>L. Chilensis</i>, however, this foramen is comparatively
larger than in <i>L. Platensis</i>, and the outer portion of the foramen forms the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>segment of a larger circle than the inner one, whilst in <i>L. Platensis</i> both portions
are equal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal difference in the dentition of the La Plata and the Chile otters,
consists in the comparatively smaller size of the posterior molars, both of the
upper and lower jaws, of the latter species. In the upper jaw, the “carnassière”
has its inner lobe, approaching somewhat to a triangular form, whereas in <i>L. Platensis</i>
it is broader and almost semicircular. In the lower jaw, the last molar but
one has the inner lobe much smaller than the middle outer lobe, whilst in
<i>L. Platensis</i> these two lobes are of nearly equal size and elevation. Other points
of dissimilarity will be perceived in the annexed table of admeasurements.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These animals are exceedingly common amongst the innumerable channels
and bays, which form the Chonos Archipelago. They may generally be seen
quietly swimming, with their heads just out of water, amidst the great entangled
beds of kelp, which abound on this coast. They burrow in the ground, within
the forest, just above the rocky shore, and I was told, that they sometimes roam
about the woods. This otter does not, by any means, live exclusively on fish.
One was shot whilst running to its hole with a large volute-shell in its mouth;
another (I believe the same species) was seen in Tierra del Fuego devouring a
cuttle fish. But in the Chonos Archipelago, perhaps the chief food of this animal,
as well as of the immense herds of great seals, and flocks of terns and
cormorants, is a red coloured crab (belonging to the family <i>Macrouri</i>) of the
size of a prawn, which swims near the surface in such dense bodies, that
the water appears of a red colour. This specimen weighed nine pounds and a
half.”—D.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>This species, which I have taken the liberty of naming after Captain FitzRoy,
the Commander of the Beagle, approaches in some respects to the <i>Delphinus

oblique dark-gray bands on the sides of the body; it likewise wants the gray
mark which extends from the angle of the mouth to the pectoral fins. In the

in the present species it is black: judging from the figures, there is likewise considerable

agrees with the dimensions, which were carefully taken by Mr. Darwin immediately
after the animal was captured, and hence is correct.</p>

<p class='c021'>Guanaco of the aborigines of Chile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Guanaco abounds over the whole of the temperate parts of South
America, from the wooded islands of Tierra del Fuego, through Patagonia, the
hilly parts of La Plata, Chile, even to the Cordillera of Peru. I saw several of
these animals in Navarin Island, forty miles north of Cape Horn; the Guanaco,
therefore, has, with the exception of a fox and mouse, inhabitants of the same
island, the most southern range of all American quadrupeds. Although preferring
an elevated site, it yields in this respect to its near relative the Vicuña.
On the plains of Southern Patagonia, we saw them in greater numbers than in
any other part. Generally they go in small herds, from half a dozen to thirty
together; but on the banks of the Santa Cruz, we saw one herd, which must have
contained at least five hundred. On the northern shores of the Strait of Magellan
they are also very numerous. The Guanacoes are generally wild and extremely
wary: Mr. Stokes told me, that he one day in Patagonia saw through a glass a
herd of these beasts, which evidently had been frightened, and were running away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>at full speed, although their distance was so great that they could not be distinguished
by the naked eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The sportsman frequently receives the first intimation of their presence, by
hearing from a long distance their peculiar shrill neighing note of alarm. If he
then looks attentively, he will, perhaps, see the herd standing in a line on the side
of some distant hill. On approaching, a few more squeals are given, and then off
they set, at an apparently slow but really quick canter, along some narrow beaten
track to a neighbouring hill. If, however, by chance he should abruptly meet a
single animal, or several together, they will generally stand motionless, and
intently gaze at him;—then, perhaps, move on a few yards, turn round, and look
again. What is the cause of this difference in their shiness? Do they mistake
a man in the distance for their chief enemy the puma? Or does curiosity overcome
their timidity? That they are curious is certain, for if a person lies on the
ground, and plays strange antics, such as throwing up his feet in the air, they
will almost always approach by degrees to reconnoitre him. It is an artifice that
was repeatedly practised with success by the sportsman of the Beagle, and it
had moreover the advantage of allowing several shots to be fired, which were all
taken as parts of the performance. On the mountains of Tierra del Fuego,
and in other places, I have more than once seen a Guanaco on being approached,
not only neigh and squeal, but prance and leap about in the most ridiculous
manner, apparently in defiance, as a challenge. These animals are very easily
domesticated, and I have seen some in this state near the houses in northern
Patagonia, although at large on their native plains. They are, when thus kept, very
bold, and readily attack a man, by striking him from behind with both knees.
It is asserted, that the motive for these attacks is jealousy on account of their
females. The wild Guanacoes, however, have no idea of defence; and even a
single dog will secure one of these large animals, till the huntsman can come up.
In many of their habits they are like sheep in a flock. Thus when they see
men approaching in several directions on horseback, they soon become bewildered,
and know not which way to run. This circumstance greatly facilitates
the Indian method of hunting, for they are thus easily driven to a central point,
and are encompassed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Guanacoes readily take to the water; several times at Port Valdes
they were seen swimming from island to island. Byron, in his voyage, says
he saw them drinking salt water. Some of our officers likewise saw a herd
apparently drinking the briny fluid from a Salina near Cape Blanco; and in
several parts of the country, if they do not drink salt water, I believe they drink
none at all. In the middle of the day, they frequently roll in the dust, in saucer-shaped
hollows. The males often fight together; one day two passed quite close
to me, squealing and trying to bite each other; and several were shot with their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>hides deeply scored. Herds appear sometimes to set out on exploring parties: at
Bahia Blanca, where within thirty miles of the coast these animals are extremely
scarce, I one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty, which had come in a direct
line to a muddy salt water creek. They then must have perceived, that they
were approaching the sea, for they had wheeled with the regularity of cavalry,
and had returned back in as straight a line, as they had advanced. The Guanacoes
have one singular habit, the motive of which is to me quite inexplicable,
namely, that on successive days they drop their dung on one defined heap. I
saw one of these heaps, which was eight feet in diameter, and necessarily was
composed of a large quantity. Frezier remarks on this habit as common to the
Guanaco as well as to the Llama;<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a> he says it is very useful to the Indians, who
use the dung for fuel, and are thus saved the trouble of collecting it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Guanacoes appear to have favourite spots for dying in. On the banks
of the Santa Cruz, the ground was actually white with bones in certain circumscribed
spaces, which generally were bushy and all near the river. On one such
spot I counted between ten and twenty heads. I particularly examined the
bones; they did not appear, as some scattered ones which I had seen, gnawed or
broken as if dragged together by a beast of prey. The animals in most cases,
must have crawled, before dying, beneath and amongst the bushes. Mr. Bynoe
informs me, that during the last voyage, he observed the same circumstances on
the banks of the Rio Gallegos. I do not at all understand the reason of this; but I
may add, that the Guanacoes which were wounded on the plains near the Santa Cruz
invariably walked towards the river. This quadruped seems particularly liable to
contain in its stomach bezoar stones. The Indians who trade at the Rio Negro,
bring great numbers to sell as Remedios or quack medicines; and I saw one old
man with a box quite full of them, large and small.”—D.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides skins of this species of stag, I find, in Mr. Darwin’s collection, three
pairs of horns, which, together with a pair belonging to one of the skins, constitute
a sufficiently complete series to illustrate the different forms which these
appendages assume, as the animal increases in size.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_029.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The above four sketches, which are all drawn to the same scale, will help to
convey a clear idea of the forms, and relative proportions, of these horns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most simple horn (fig. 1.) consists of a <i>beam</i>, eight and a half inches
long, which is slightly arched outwards and considerably compressed about two
and a half inches from the apex. At one inch from the base there is a small brow
antler which projects forwards and upwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next horn, (fig. 2.) there is the same small brow antler, but there is a
single small <i>snag</i>, about equal in size to the brow antler, which is directed backwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and upwards, and is situated at three and a quarter inches from the apex of
the beam. The total length of the beam is eight inches, measured in a straight
line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third pair of horns, (fig. 3.) which must have belonged to an animal considerably
older than either of the preceding pairs, exhibits a large brow antler, in
length exceeding half that of the beam: here the posterior snag is also large,
and is directed backwards and upwards, whilst the apical portion of the beam is
directed forward about as much as the snag is directed backwards. The total
length of this horn is eleven and a half inches, measured in a straight line.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last figure (No. 4.) represents the horn of one of the specimens of which
an entire skin was brought over. This horn differs only from the last in being
slightly larger, and in having two additional small snags, one springing from the
under side, and near the apex, of the brow antler, and the other springing from
the hinder part, and near the apex of the great posterior snag.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Spaniards say they can distinguish how old a deer is by the number
of the branches on the horns. They affirmed that the specimen, of which figure 4
represents one of the horns, was nine years old. It certainly was a very old one,
as all its teeth were decayed. This specimen was killed at Maldonado, in the
middle of June; another specimen was killed at Bahia Blanca, (about three hundred
and sixty miles southward,) in the month of October, with the hairy skin on
the horns: there were others, however, whose horns were free from skin. At this
time of the year, many of the does had just kidded. I was informed, by the
Spaniards, that this deer sheds its horns every year.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The <i>Cervus campestris</i> is exceedingly abundant throughout the countries
bordering the Plata. It is found in Northern Patagonia as far south as the Rio
Negro, (Lat. 41°); but, further southward, none were seen by the officers employed
in surveying the coast. It appears to prefer a hilly country; I saw very
many small herds, containing from five to seven animals each, near the Sierra
Ventana, and among the hills north of Maldonado. If a person, crawling close
along the ground, slowly advances towards a herd, the deer frequently approach,
out of curiosity, to reconnoitre him. I have by this means killed, from one
spot, three out of the same herd. Although thus so tame and inquisitive, yet,
when approached on horseback, they are exceedingly wary. In this country
nobody goes on foot, and the deer knows man as its enemy, only when he is
mounted, and armed with the bolas. At Bahia Blanca, a recent establishment
in Northern Patagonia, I was surprised to find how little the deer cared for
the noise of a gun: one day, I fired ten times, from within eighty yards, at one
animal, and it was much more startled at the ball cutting up the ground, than at
the report.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The most curious fact, with respect to this animal, is the overpoweringly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the buck. It is quite indescribable:
several times, whilst skinning the specimen, which is now mounted at the
Zoological Museum, I was almost overcome by nausea. I tied up the skin in a
silk pocket-handkerchief, and so carried it home: this handkerchief, after being
well washed, I continually used, and it was, of course, as repeatedly washed; yet
every time, when first unfolded, for a space of one year and seven months, I distinctly
perceived the odour. This appears an astonishing instance of the permanence
of some matter, which in its nature, nevertheless, must be most subtile and
volatile. Frequently, when passing at the distance of half a mile to leeward of a
herd, I have perceived the whole air tainted with the effluvium. I believe the
smell from the buck is most powerful at the period when its horns are perfect, or
free from the hairy skin. When in this state the meat is, of course, quite
uneatable; but the Spaniards assert, that if buried for some time in fresh
earth, the taint is removed. These deer generally weigh about sixty or seventy
pounds.”—D.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>1. <span class='sc'>Mus decumanus.</span><br> <span class='small'>Mus decumanus, <i>Auctorum</i>.</span></h3>

<p class='c020'>In the extensive collection of Rodent animals brought home by Mr. Darwin,
I find several specimens of the above named species, that is to say, animals which
resemble the European specimens of <i>Mus Decumanus</i> in all those characters which
are the least liable to variation in individuals of the same species, such as the
proportions which the various parts of the animal bear to each other: they
differ, however, somewhat in colouring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buenos Ayres, Maldonado, Valparaiso, East Falkland Island, and Keeling
Island, are each, it appears, infested with the common European rat. I have
now before me two specimens from East Falkland Island, and one specimen
from each of the other localities, and among these I find none equal in size to the
largest European specimens: as regards the colouring, the Buenos Ayres specimen
differs only from the English specimens of <i>Mus Decumanus</i>, in having the
upper parts of a richer and deeper hue, owing to the tips of the shorter hairs being
of a deep yellow instead of pale yellow, and in having a rusty tint over the
haunches.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Mr. Darwin found this variety “common about houses in the country around
Buenos Ayres.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Maldonado variety, the shorter hairs of the upper parts of the body are
of a rusty yellow colour at the apex, in other respects it resembles the British
variety. The rusty yellow colour of the tips of the hairs produces a general reddish
hue, which is the more conspicuous, when the animal is placed near an
English specimen. “Was caught in a house, at Maldonado. I saw a specimen
of the common gray English, or Norway rat, lying dead in the streets, and it certainly
had a very different appearance from these red rats. The latter, I saw
crawling about the hedges in the interior provinces at Santa Fé, and likewise in
the forest of the island of Chiloe. This latter fact, however, is a strong argument
against its being aboriginal, since I did not find even one undoubted American
species, out of the many which I collected, inhabiting both sides of the Cordillera.”—D.</p>

<p class='c007'>The specimen from Valparaiso very closely resembles that from Maldonado;
it is, perhaps, a little less red. “Common about the houses in the town of Valparaiso.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two specimens from East Falkland are of a brighter hue, and have less
gray in their colouring, than in the European variety of the common rat. “One
of them was caught in a Bay, which is sometimes frequented by shipping, but
which is distant thirty or forty miles from any habitation. These rats have
spread, not only over the whole of East and West Falkland, but even on some
of the outlying islets. When the cold, wet, and gloomy nature of the climate
is considered, it is surprising that these animals should be able to find food to
live on.”—D.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general hue of the Keeling Island specimen, is deep brown, the longer
hairs of the upper parts of the body being, as usual, black; but the shorter hairs,
instead of having the pale yellow tint which we observe in the European, (or,
rather, British) specimens of <i>Mus Decumanus</i>, are of a deep, rusty yellow. The
most remarkable difference, however, consists in the colouring of the under parts
being of a yellowish tint, and, towards the root of the tail, of a very distinct buff
yellow: the feet are brownish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This rat is exceedingly numerous on some of the low coral islets forming
the margin of the Lagoon of Keeling Island, in the Indian Ocean. The climate is
dry and hot. The rats are known to have come in a vessel from the Mauritius,
which was wrecked on one of the islets, which is now called Rat Island. They
appeared stunted in their growth, and many of them were mangy. They are
supposed to live chiefly on cocoa-nuts, and any animal matter the sea may chance
to throw up. They have not any fresh water; but the milk of the cocoa-nut
would supply its place.”—D.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>This rat is very closely allied to <i>Mus decumanus</i>, and I think may possibly

<p class='c018'>Habitat, James Island, Galapagos Archipelago, Pacific Ocean, (<i>October</i>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is scarcely equal in size to a full grown common black rat, (<i>Mus
Rattus</i>), the head is rather shorter in proportion, the tarsi are smaller, and the
tail is longer. In the character of the fur, and length of the hairs, it <i>very</i> closely
resembles that species: the ears are larger than in <i>M. decumanus</i>, and about
equal to those of <i>M. Rattus</i>. In having the hairs of the under parts of the body
of an uniform colour, (i. e. not gray at the base,) it resembles the <i>Mus Tectorum</i>
of Savi; but the large size of that animal, the greater length of the fur, and its
colouring, all serve to distinguish it from the present species, which I may here
observe, is truly an old world form, and very distinct from another species, also
from the Galapagos, which is hereafter described.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is very common in James Island, but is not found on all the islands,
if on any other in the Archipelago. Although its appearance is so like that of
the common rat, yet its habits appear to be rather different: it is less carnivorous,
and does not appear to be so strongly attached to the habitations of man.
This island was frequented, about one hundred and fifty years since, by the vessels
belonging to the Bucaniers; so that the common rat might easily have been
transported here. And if a very peculiar climate, a volcanic soil, and strange
food, can together produce a race, or strongly marked variety, there is every
probability of such change having taken place in this case.”—D.</p>

<p class='c015'>No. 2. Hairs along the centre of the back chiefly black, and but obscurely
annulated, near the apex, with deep yellow: towards the sides of the body,
and over the haunches, the hairs are more distinctly annulated, and on the
sides of the body they are of a pale yellow at the apex: on the under parts
the hairs are gray, tipped with dirty yellowish white: the feet are of the
same deep purple-brown hue as in the specimen first described.</p>

<p class='c015'>Habitat, Ascension Island, Atlantic Ocean, (<i>July</i>.)</p>

<p class='c007'>These two animals not only differ in the colour of the fur, one being of a
grizzled brownish colour, and the other black, but there is a considerable difference
in the texture of the fur. In the black specimen, the fur is very soft and glossy,
and the long hairs, which are abundant, are very slender. In the brown specimen,
the fur is of a harsher nature, the long hairs are not so abundant, but longer, and
less slender. On the other hand, they agree in size, dentition, the length of the
head, tarsus, and ears, and differ but in a trifling degree (about three lines,) in the
length of the tail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon comparing the Ascension Island specimens with <i>M. Rattus</i>, I find
that, although in size they are about one-third less, yet the teeth precisely agree,
not only in form, but in size. The relative proportions of the head, ears, and
tarsi, also agree. Besides the general colouring of the fur, they both differ in
having the hairs of the feet uniformly purple-black, those in <i>Mus Rattus</i> being
much paler, and even whitish, on the toes. In the character of the fur, there is
much difference. The long silky hairs, which are so conspicuous in <i>Mus
Rattus</i>, are replaced, in the black specimen, by hairs which are scarcely to
be distinguished from the ordinary fur; and in the other specimen, although
rather longer and more distinct, they are short, compared with those of the
black rat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The specimen which has a black, and glossy fur, frequents the short coarse
grass near the summit of the island, where the common mouse likewise occurs.
It is often seen running about by day, and was found in numbers, when the
island was first colonized by the English, a few years since. The other, and
browner coloured variety, lives in the out-houses near the sea-beach, and feeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>chiefly on the offal of the turtles, slaughtered for the daily food of the inhabitants.
If the settlement were destroyed, I feel no doubt that this latter variety would be
compelled to migrate from the coast. Did it originally descend from the summit?
and, in the case just supposed, would it retreat there? and, if so, would its black
colour return? It must, however, be observed, that the two localities are separated
from each other by a space, some miles in width, of bare lava and ashes.
Does the summit of Ascension, an island so immensely remote from any continent,
and the summit itself surrounded by a broad fringe of desert volcanic soil,
possess a small quadruped, peculiar to itself? Or, more probably, has this new
species been brought, by some ship, from some unknown quarter of the world?
Or, I am again tempted to ask, as I did in the case of the Galapagos rat, has the
common English species been changed, by its new habitation, into a strongly
marked variety?”—D.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Darwin seems to have foreseen the difficult problem which these two rats
have furnished, and although I have spent much time in studying the Muridæ, I
must confess I have been exceedingly puzzled by the animals in question. It
appears as if the brown, and black rats, (<i>M. decumanus</i>, and <i>M. Rattus</i>,) and
likewise the common mouse, (<i>M. Musculus</i>,)<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a> all of which follow man in his
peregrinations, and which, to a certain degree, are dependent upon man, and may
therefore be termed semi-domestic animals; like <i>really</i> domestic animals, are subject
to a greater degree of variation than those species which hold themselves
aloof from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the whole then I have determined to describe the two Ascension
Island specimens as one species, and as varieties of the <i>Mus Rattus</i>, but with
a mark of doubt, since I do not possess sufficient materials for a rigorous examination,
having, in fact, but one skin of each variety, and neither skull nor
skeleton. I have also applied the name of <i>insularis</i>, to designate this variety
or species, whichever it may be, for, supposing it be not a distinct species, it is
so marked a variety, that a name for it is desirable.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mus Musculus, <i>Auctorum</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of this species, there are six specimens in Mr. Darwin’s collection; two
were found “living in the short grass, near the summit of the Island of Ascension,
where the climate is temperate.”—D. Two others were procured “on a small,
stony, and arid island, near Porto Praya, the capital of St. Jago, in the Cape
de Verde Islands,—climate very hot and dry. Excepting during the rainy season,
which is of short duration, these little animals can never taste fresh water, nor
does the island afford any succulent plant.”—D. A specimen was also procured
“on a grassy cliff, on East Falkland Island, at the distance of a mile
from any habitation. It is singular that so delicate an animal should be able
to subsist under the cold, and extremely humid climate, of the Falkland Islands,
and on its unproductive soil.”—D. These specimens are all of them rather less
than full grown individuals of the same species procured in England; in other
respects, they do not differ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sixth specimen, which is from Maldonado, is considerably less than
British specimens of the common mouse, and is of a richer and brighter colour,
the head is smaller, the muzzle shorter in proportion, whilst the tarsi are even longer
than in a large specimen of <i>M. Musculus</i>. These points of dissimilarity induced
me to believe it was a distinct species, and to apply to it the specific name of
<i>brevirostris</i>.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Upon re-examination, with the advantage of more experience,
and consequently a better knowledge of the characters of these animals, I have
changed my opinion. The teeth indicate that it is not an adult specimen, and
agree perfectly with those of <i>M. Musculus</i>, both in form and size. “Common
in the houses of the town of Maldonado, and its habits are similar to those of
<i>Mus Musculus</i>.”—D.</p>

tubercle on the under side of the wrist is also larger. The thumb nail is flattened,
and rounded at the tip, as in <i>Mus Musculus</i>, but is longer, and more distinct than
in that animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skull of <i>M. longicaudatus</i>, (Plate 34, Fig. 1,) is considerably larger than
that of the common mouse, but in form scarcely differs from it; its upper surface is
rather more convex, and the interparietal bone proportionately less. The length of
the skull is 1 inch; breadth, 6½ lines; distance between the forepart of the incisor,

having the tail a trifle shorter. The skull is about ¾ of a line shorter, but its
proportions agree precisely: the proportions of the feet, and the general form of the
animal, also agree. This specimen is likewise from Chile, (Lat 37° 40′,) and, according
to Mr. Darwin, “overran the wooded country south of Concepcion, in swarms
of infinite numbers. Captain FitzRoy, on his return from visiting the wreck of
H. M. S. Challenger, had the kindness to bring me this specimen. So destructive
was this little animal, that it even gnawed through the paper of the cartridges
belonging to the people who were wrecked.”—D.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon comparing the skull (Pl. 34, fig. 2, <i>a.</i>) of <i>M. elegans</i> with that of <i>M.
Musculus</i>, the most evident points of distinction consist in the greater proportionate
length of the nasal and frontal bones, and the slenderness of the zygomatic arch
in the former animal. Length of skull 11 lines, width 6 lines, distance between
front molar and outer side of incisors of upper jaw 3⅜ lines, length of nasal
bones 4⅜ lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dentition is figured in Pl. 34, figs. 2. <i>b</i>, and 2. <i>c</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whilst bivouacking one night on shore, amongst some sand hillocks, this
mouse, with its tail singed, leapt out of a bush which was placed on the fire. Its
hind legs appeared long in proportion to the front, and it did not appear to be
very active in endeavouring to make its escape.”—D.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mus elegans</i> is about equal in size to <i>M. Musculus</i>; the head is larger in
proportion than in the latter, the ears are slightly larger, the tail is longer, and
so are the tarsi. The large ears, long tail, and comparatively large size of the
feet, combined with the greater size of the animal itself, will render it easy to
distinguish this species from <i>M. gracilipes</i> and <i>M. bimaculatus</i>. From the last
mentioned animal it moreover differs in having the head larger in proportion,
the fur longer, and the colouring of the upper parts of the body somewhat darker.
The white fur is almost confined to the under parts of the body, and there is but
a small tuft of white hairs behind the ears, whereas in <i>M. bimaculatus</i>, the white
fur extends considerably on the sides of the body, the outer side of the limbs are
white, and there is a large and conspicuous white spot behind each ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>M. elegans</i> the whole sole of the tarsus and the carpal tubercles are
covered with hair. In <i>Mus bimaculatus</i> the hinder <i>half</i> of the tarsus only is
covered with hair, and in <i>M. gracilipes</i> both the hinder half is covered, and there
are some scattered hairs extending almost to the two tubercles, which are situated
at the base of the longer toes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The genus <i>Eligmodontia</i> of M. F. Cuvier, founded upon a species of mouse
from Buenos Ayres, possesses nearly the same characters as the subgenus
<i>Calomys</i>, established by me in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for
February 1837, and which included the animal above described, and two other
species (<i>M. bimaculatus</i> and <i>M. gracilipes</i>). M. Cuvier’s genus is distinguished
by there being only one large tubercle on the under side of the tarsus, and in
having the carpal pad covered with hair as well as the pad of the tarsus. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>these characters our present animal agrees, as it does also in size and in the relative
proportions of the tail and tarsus, circumstances which induce me to believe they
are identical.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>M. bimaculatus</i> and <i>M. gracilipes</i> there are six naked tubercles on the
under side of the tarsus, and the carpal pad is also naked. In having, however, the
tarsus hairy beneath,<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> in dentition and in colouring, they agree so closely with

patch of pure white hairs behind each ear. The feet and tail are of a pale
flesh-colour, and furnished with white hairs, with the exception of those on
the upper surface of the latter, which are pale brown. The ears are also
pale flesh-colour, clothed internally with yellow hairs; externally on the fore

(when it occurs) is usually confined to the under part of the body, or extends
but slightly on the sides, is in the present animal extended considerably on
the sides of the body, and occupies an equal portion with the yellow of the upper
parts. The name <i>bimaculatus</i> is applied to this animal on account of the two
conspicuous white patches, which are situated behind the ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>In affinity as well as in appearance it most nearly approaches to <i>Mus
gracilipes</i> and <i>M. elegans</i>; with no other species of the genus <i>Mus</i>, here described,
can it be confounded, since these only have the tarsus hairy beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal points of distinction between the present animal and <i>Mus
elegans</i>, are noticed in the account of that species.</p>

hairs are black. The feet, tail, under parts of the body and the sides of the
muzzle, are pure white. All the hairs of the body, (which are soft, and of
moderate length), are deep gray at the base. The ears are of moderate
size, well clothed with hairs, of which those on the inner side are yellowish,
and those on the outer, are brown on the anterior part, and white on the
posterior. A small tuft of white hairs springs from the neck immediately
behind the ears; this tuft is hidden when the ears are folded back. The tail
is slender and short, (being not quite equal to the body in length) of a pale
flesh-colour, and sparingly furnished with minute white hairs. The feet are
very small and slender, and the naked parts are of a pale flesh-colour. The
sole of the foot is covered with hairs; the toes beneath, and the tubercles
(which are as in <i>Mus Musculus</i>), however, are naked. The hairs of the
moustaches are of moderate length, and of a blackish colour, some of them,
however, are grayish white.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species slightly exceeds the harvest mouse (<i>Mus messorius</i>) in size, its
ears are considerably larger in proportion, and the tail is shorter. Compared
with the common mouse (<i>Mus Musculus</i>) it is smaller, the tail is more slender,
and shorter, and the feet are likewise more slender and proportionately much
smaller; the ears are more distinctly clothed with hairs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The principal points of distinction between this and the two preceding

<p class='c007'>Upon comparing the skull of <i>M. gracilipes</i> (Pl. 34, fig. 4. <i>a</i>.) with that of <i>Mus
Musculus</i>, the most striking differences consist in its shorter and broader form, the
upper surface being more arched, the interparietal bone has a relatively smaller
antero-posterior diameter, the occipital region is more convex, and continued more
gently and gradually into the upper region of the skull. The zygomatic arch,
which is unusually slender, is more dilated (especially on the anterior part)
thus giving a squareness to the general form. The nasal bones are not so much
attenuated posteriorly. The length of the skull is 8⅞ lines, the greatest width is
5⅛ lines, and the distance between the outer side of the incisors and the front
molar is 2¾ lines.</p>

<p class='c006'>Subsequent to the description of this species, under the name of <i>M. olivaceus</i>
in the Zoological Society’s Proceedings, I have imagined that perhaps that name
might mislead as regards the colouring of the animal;—it certainly has a slight

substituted that of the author of the “Naturgeschichte der Säugethiere von Paraguay,”

not. Both of <i>Mus canescens</i> and of <i>Mus xanthorhinus</i>, I have before me what I
imagine to be an adult and a young specimen. The adult and the young of
<i>M. xanthorhinus</i> agree in being of a <i>yellowish brown</i> colour, and in having the
muzzle and tarsi deep yellow; both specimens of <i>Mus canescens</i> are of a <i>gray</i>
colour, with an indistinct yellow wash, the muzzle and tarsi being tinted with
yellow, as in <i>M. xanthorhinus</i>. Besides this difference in tint, which, perhaps,
is unimportant, <i>M. canescens</i> differs from <i>M. xanthorhinus</i> in having the head
larger, the tail rather longer, and the fur less soft. The specimens of this animal
are both from Patagonia; one of the specimens of <i>Mus xanthorhinus</i> was brought
by Mr. Darwin from Terra del Fuego; and as the other formed part of Captain
King’s collection, it in all probability came from the same locality. As I only
possess one skull, I cannot speak with certainty as regards the size of the head;
the difference, however, in the stuffed specimens is considerable, and it is strange
that each of the pairs should agree so perfectly, supposing the difference to be
the work of the stuffer’s hands.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Bahia Blanca, (<i>September</i>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>This species is nearly equal in size to the common rat (<i>Mus decumanus</i>). Of
its skull<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a> I possess but the anterior portion (see Pl. 33. fig. 3, <i>a.</i> and 3, <i>b.</i>): it
appears to have been about the same size as that of <i>M. decumanus</i>, its proportions,
however, are different: the nasal portion is broader and shorter, the ant-orbital
outlet is rather smaller; the plate, forming the anterior root of the zygomatic
arch, and which protects this outlet, has its anterior edge distinctly emarginated,
and not nearly straight as in <i>M. decumanus</i>,—the zygomatic arch is stouter, the
space between the orbits is narrower, the palate is more contracted, the incisors
are much broader, less deep from front to back, and have the anterior surface
more convex; the molar teeth are larger; the lower jaw (see Plate 34. fig. 12, <i>a.</i>)
when compared with that of <i>Mus decumanus</i> also offers many points of dissimilarity;
the principal differences consist in its greater strength, the comparatively
large size and breadth of the articular surface of the condyles, the
upright position of the coronoid process—a perpendicular line dropt from the
apex of which would touch the posterior part of the last molar—and the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>extent of the <i>symphysis menti</i>. In the form of the incisors, the more contracted
palate, the great extent of the <i>symphysis menti</i>, and in fact in most of the points
of dissimilarity, between the skull of the present animal and that of <i>Mus decumanus</i>,
here pointed out, it will be perceived, there is an approach made to the
<i>Arvicolidæ</i>.</p>

their being taken) are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“This rat was caught at Bahia Blanca where the plains of Patagonia begin
to blend into the more fertile region of the Pampas. It lived in holes amongst
the tussocks of rushes, on the borders of a small, still, brook; in its manner of
diving and aquatic habits it closely resembled the English water-rat, (<i>Arvicola
amphibia</i>.)”—D.</p>

<p class='c007'>When at Paris I examined what I believe to be the original <i>Mus Braziliensis</i>,
since the specimen was labelled “<i>Rat de Brazil St. Hilaire, 1818</i>.” It agrees
perfectly with the present animal excepting in being rather smaller, the length
from the nose to the tail being 7 inches and 4 lines—the length of the tail is 7
inches 9 lines, and that of the tarsus is 1 inch 11 lines; this difference in the
length of the body may arise from difference of age, or even of sex. In the Paris
Museum I saw what appeared to me to be a variety of the same species in which
the under parts of the body are white.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have been minute in my description of the <i>Mus Braziliensis</i>, since it is
confounded by Desmarest, Fischer and Lesson with the <i>Rat troisieme</i> or <i>Rat
Angouya</i> of Azara, which I believe to be a very different animal. The description
given by the authors just mentioned are taken from Azara, who gives the
following characters to distinguish the <i>Rat Angouya</i>: “Du museau à la queue, et
sur les côtés du corps tout est brun-cannelle, parceque les poils ont une petite
pointe cannelle; puis, ils sont obscurs et enfin blanc vers las peau. Toute la partie
inférieure de l’animal est blanchâtre, plus claire sous la tête, et plus foncée entre
les jambes de devant; le pelage est doux, très-serr, et le poil, qui est à la racine
de l’oreille, cache le conduit de celle-ci.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three specimens of the present species in Mr. Darwin’s collection;
two of them were caught when shedding their fur, and having lost the longer black

having smaller ears which are well clothed with hair, and not sparingly furnished

densely clothed with hairs; in the structure of the molar teeth there also differences

<p class='c007'>The present genus according to my views belongs to the family <i>Muridæ</i>. The
modifications of structure which have led me to separate it from the genus <i>Mus</i>
are as follows:</p>

<p class='c025'><i>External characters.</i>—The most conspicuous points of distinction between the
external characters of <i>Reithrodon</i> and <i>Mus</i> (if we regard <i>M. rattus</i>, <i>M. decumanus</i>
or <i>M. musculus</i> as typical examples of that genus,) consist in the arched
form of the head, the large size of the eyes, the stout form of the body, and
the upper incisors being grooved. The ears, tail and feet are more densely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>clothed with hairs, and the tarsus is covered with hair beneath,—at least the
hinder portion.</p>

<p class='c025'><i>Cranium.</i>—The skulls of the species of the present genus differ from those of the
species of <i>Mus</i> in being proportionately shorter and broader, and more
arched; the facial portion of the skull is larger, compared with the cranial,
the space between the orbits is narrower, and the orbits are larger; the
palate is narrower and the incisive foramina are more elongated and larger.
The pterygoids approximate anteriorly, so that the posterior <i>nares</i> are greatly
contracted. As in the genus <i>Mus</i> the anterior root of the zygomatic arch is
directed upwards from the plane of the palate, and forwards in the form of a
thin plate, protecting an opening behind, which leads into the nasal cavity,
and also forming the outer boundary both of the ant-orbital foramen, and a
second opening whose outlet is directed upwards. This thin plate, however,
is narrower than is usually found in the genus <i>Mus</i>. The most striking differences
observable in the lower jaw consist in the smaller size of the coronoid
process, and its being curved outwards; the condyloid process is narrower,
and the angle of the jaw, or descending ramus, approaches more nearly to a
quadrate form—the posterior edge of the jaw is more deeply emarginated.</p>

<p class='c025'><i>Dentition.</i>—The incisors are narrow and compressed as in the genus <i>Mus</i>, but
they are less deep from front to back; those of the upper jaw (Plate 33. fig 2.
<i>b.</i>) have each a distinct longitudinal groove, which is situated nearer to the
outer than to the inner edge of the tooth. Close to the inner edge of each
of these teeth an indistinct second longitudinal groove may be seen by
means of a lens. The lower incisors are nearly equal in width to the upper.</p>

<p class='c025'>The crowns of the molar teeth in the young <i>Reithrodon</i> are higher than in <i>Mus</i>,
and they are rootless; in the adult animal, however, they possess distinct
roots. The folds of enamel form sigmoid flexures, are closely approximated
to each other, and those of the opposite sides of the tooth meet.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, South shore of the Strait of Magellan, near the Eastern entrance.</p>

<p class='c006'>This little animal was preserved in spirit, and has since been mounted, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>probable, therefore, that the colours have been slightly changed. It is of a smaller
size than either of the preceding species. Its fur is long, extremely soft, and
somewhat resembles that of the Chinchilla. The ears are smaller, and the tail
is shorter, and less densely clothed with hairs than in <i>Reithrodon cuniculoides</i>.
The skull (see Plate 43, fig. 20, <i>a</i>, 20, <i>b</i>, and 20, <i>c</i>,) differs in many respects
from that of the species last mentioned. It is of a smaller size, the nasal portion
is proportionately shorter and narrower, the incisive foramina are shorter; the
pterygoid processes do not approximate so nearly at their base, and the pterygoid
fossæ are very shallow, whereas in <i>R. cuniculoides</i> they are deep. In the skull
of the animal just mentioned there are two distinct longitudinal grooves on the
palate, which extend backwards from the incisive foramina, and terminate in two
rather large and deep excavations: these excavations are in the palatine bone,
and situated between the last molar teeth; they are separated from each other by
a narrow, longitudinal, elevated ridge; a narrow ridge also separates them from
the pterygoid fossæ. At the bottom of each of these hollows are several minute
foramina, and in front of them there are two larger longitudinal foramina. In
<i>R. chinchilloides</i>, the longitudinal grooves on the palate and the posterior hollows
are shallow, and consequently much less distinct; the pterygoid fossæ are very
nearly on the same plane as the palate, and are indicated only by a very slight
depression. The incisor teeth are broader than in <i>R. chinchilloides</i>, and the molar
teeth are proportionately smaller. The thin plate which forms the anterior root
of the zygomatic arch is deeply emarginated in front in <i>R. cuniculoides</i> (see
Plate 34, fig. 21, <i>b.</i>); but in <i>R. chinchilloides</i>, the anterior margin of this plate is
nearly straight, (see Plate 34, fig. 20, <i>c.</i>)</p>

<p class='c007'>In the form of the lower jaw of the two animals under consideration there are
differences which will be more clearly understood upon comparing the figures. I
will therefore merely notice one remarkable character which is found in <i>R. cuniculoides</i>,
and that is, that the condyloid process is rather deeply concave on the
inner side, a character which does not exist in <i>R. chinchilloides</i>, nor do I recollect
having observed it in any other Rodent.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><i>General Observations upon the foregoing Species of Muridæ.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>In the foregoing descriptions I have endeavoured to convey an idea of the
characters of the species of mice submitted to me for examination and description,
by Mr. Darwin: there are, however, some points upon which I have been silent
in my descriptions. I allude to the characters observable in the dentition. I
have omitted to notice the various modifications in the structure of the molar teeth,
because I found it would lengthen the descriptions to no good purpose, inasmuch
as of almost all the species I have made outlines of the molars, which will convey
a more clear idea than any verbal description can do.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon an inspection of the Plates, it will be seen, that by far the greater
portion of the teeth figured, may be referred to one particular type of form or
pattern, and that this pattern does not agree with that observed in the molars of
<i>Mus Rattus</i>, <i>M. decumanus</i>, or <i>M. musculus</i>, whilst these three species agree
essentially with each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the young Black Rat (<i>Mus Rattus</i>), before the teeth are worn, the two
anterior molar teeth, on either side of the upper jaw, present three longitudinal
rows of tubercles, a central series of larger tubercles, and on each side of these, a
row of smaller ones. The front molar has three of the larger tubercles arranged
along the middle of the tooth; three smaller ones on the outer side, and two, on
the inner side. The second molars have two central tubercles, two outer, and two
inner ones. The posterior molar is nearly round, the body of the tooth consists of
three principal tubercles, and one small tubercle, situated on the inner and
anterior portion of the tooth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The corresponding teeth in the young of <i>Mus bimaculatus</i> present a very
different appearance; the molars, instead of having three longitudinal rows of
tubercles, have only two. An idea of the appearance of these teeth may be
formed by removing the inner row of tubercles from the molars of <i>Mus rattus</i>.
We should then have, as in <i>Mus bimaculatus</i>, molars of a narrower form, the first
tooth presenting six tubercles, the second, four; and the posterior tooth devoid of
the small inner lobe; the opposing tubercles of each tooth, however, in <i>M. bimaculatus</i>,
are of equal size.</p>

<p class='c007'>The molars of the lower jaw of <i>Mus bimaculatus</i> agree with those of <i>M. Rattus</i>
as to the number of tubercles which they possess; they are, however, proportionately
longer and narrower, and, when a little worn, these teeth, as well as
those of the upper jaw, differ considerably from those of <i>M. Rattus</i>. In the last
named animal, when the molars are slightly worn, the ridges of enamel run
completely across the tooth, as in Figs. 18 and 19, Plate 34. Such is not the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>in <i>M. bimaculatus</i> at any age. As soon as the molar teeth are worn, the folds of
enamel penetrate the body of the tooth on each side, and those of one side alternate
with those of the other,—in fact, they very nearly resemble those of the
<i>Hamsters</i> (<i>Cricetus</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>I have selected the molar teeth of <i>Mus Rattus</i> and <i>M. bimaculatus</i> for comparison,
since I happened to possess specimens displaying both the young and
adult states of each. But had I selected, on the one hand, almost any of the
species brought from South America by Mr. Darwin, and, on the other hand,
the <i>Mus musculus</i> or <i>M. decumanus</i>, I should have had to point out the same
distinctions—the former agreeing in dentition with <i>M. bimaculatus</i>, and the latter
with <i>M. Rattus</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The differences pointed out, between the molar teeth of <i>Mus Rattus</i> and
those of <i>M. bimaculatus</i>, I cannot but consider as important, since all the Old
World species of <i>Mus</i> which I have yet had an opportunity of examining (and
they are numerous) agree essentially with the former, whilst the only <i>Mus</i> from
S. America (excepting <i>M. Musculus</i> and <i>M. decumanus</i>, which are carried in ships
to all parts of the world) in which I have as yet found molar teeth like those of
<i>M. Rattus</i>, is the <i>Mus Maurus</i>, and this it has been stated is possibly a variety
of <i>M. decumanus</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although as yet I have not met with species in the Old World possessing
the characters of the South American <i>Muridæ</i>, among those of North America,
several have come under my observation. The <i>Mus leucopus</i>, <i>Symidon hispidum</i>,
and the species of <i>Neotoma</i> certainly belong to the same group,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> as does also the
species of the Galapagos Islands, described in this work under the name <i>Galapagoensis</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>These considerations have induced me to separate the South American mice
from those of the Old World,—or rather from that group of which <i>M. decumanus</i>
may be regarded as the type,—and to place them, together with such North
American species as agree with them in dentition, in a new genus bearing the
name <i>Hesperomys</i>.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Whether this group be confined to the Western hemisphere or not, I will not
venture to say, but I think I may safely affirm that that portion of the globe is
their chief metropolis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The species of the genus <i>Hesperomys</i>, which depart most from the type—whose
dentition is least like figs. 5, <i>a</i>, and 5, <i>b</i>, Plate 33., or 6, <i>a</i>, and 6, <i>b</i>, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>same Plate—recede still farther from the genus <i>Mus</i>, and approach more nearly
(as regards the dentition) to the <i>Arvicolidæ</i>. Among the species here described I
may mention as examples, <i>M. griseo-flavus</i>, <i>M. zanthopygus</i>, and <i>M. Darwinii</i>;—see
the molar teeth figured in Plate 34. figs. 15, 16, and 17,—and among the
North American species, those constituting the genus <i>Neotoma</i>. The latter make
by far the nearest approach to the <i>Arvicolidæ</i> of any which have yet come under
my observation, not only in the dentition, but in the form of the skull and the
large size of the coronoid process of the lower jaw; there is, nevertheless, a
tolerably well marked line of distinction between the crania of the <i>Arvicolidæ</i>
and <i>Neotoma</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skulls of the animals belonging to the genera <i>Castor</i>, <i>Ondatra</i>, <i>Arvicola</i>,
<i>Spalax</i>, and <i>Geomys</i>, which constitute the principal groups of the family
<i>Arvicolidæ</i>, when compared with those of the family <i>Muridæ</i>, present, among
others, the following distinctive characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The temporal <i>fossæ</i> are always much contracted posteriorly, by the great
anterior and lateral development of the temporal bones; the plane of the intermolar
portion of the palate is below the level of the anterior portion; the coronoid
process of the lower jaw is very large, the articular portion of the condyloid
process is proportionately broad; the descending ramus, or posterior coronoid
process, is so situated that its upper portion terminates considerably above the
level of the crowns of the molars; this same process is generally<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a> directed
outwards from the plane of the horizontal ramus. The incisor teeth of the <i>Arvicolidæ</i>
differ from those of the <i>Muridæ</i> in being proportionately broader and
less deep from front to back—they are not laterally compressed as in <i>Mus</i>. The
molar teeth are rootless,<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and the folds of enamel are the same throughout the
whole length of the tooth; whereas in <i>Mus</i> they enter less and less deeply into
the body of the tooth as we recede from the crown, and towards the base of the
visible portion (the tooth being in its socket) the indentations of the enamel
are obliterated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now in the species of <i>Hesperomys</i>, the molar teeth are always rooted, and in
the form of the skull and the lower jaw they agree with the <i>Muridæ</i>, and do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>present the characters above pointed out as distinguishing the <i>Arvicolidæ</i>, and as
regards the cranium and lower jaw, it is only in the genus <i>Neotoma</i> that any approach
is evinced.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the various groups of the order <i>Rodentia</i> found in South America, the
<i>Sciuridæ</i>, so far as I am aware, are chiefly confined to the more northern parts, and
do not occur in the most southern; the <i>Myoxidæ</i>, <i>Gerboidæ</i>, and <i>Arvicolidæ</i> are
wanting. The species of the family <i>Muridæ</i> belong to different sections to those
of the Old World. Of the <i>Leporidæ</i> I am acquainted only with one well established
species—the <i>Lepus Braziliensis</i>, which however is not found “in tota
America Australi,” as Fischer says, there being no Hare yet found in the more
southern parts, where the <i>Cavies</i> and <i>Chinchillas</i> appear to take their place. The
remaining South American Rodents—certain species of <i>Hystricidæ</i>, the genera,
<i>Echimys</i>, <i>Dasyprocta</i>, <i>Cælogenys</i> and <i>Myopotamus</i>, together with the <i>Octodontidæ</i>
and <i>Chinchillidæ</i>, all possess a peculiar form of skull and of the lower jaw, (more
or less approaching to figs. 1, Plate 33, and figs. 23, Plate 34.) which I have
described in the “Magazine of Natural History,” for February 1839, and which is
rarely found in the North American, or Old World Rodents. In enumerating the
above groups, I omitted the <i>Caviidæ</i>, because in the form of the lower jaw they
differ somewhat from the rest—they possess, in fact, a form of lower jaw peculiar
to themselves; but in the Chinchillas<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a> the transitions between one form and the
other are found.</p>

<p class='c007'>The South American <i>Muridæ</i>, which form the chief part of Mr. Darwin’s
collection, were none of them procured further north than latitude 30°, with
the exception of those from the Galapagos Archipelago. The species occur at
the following localities.</p>

<p class='c020'>“This animal, in Chile, is known by the name of “Coypu;” at Buenos Ayres,
where an extensive trade is carried on with their skins, they are improperly
called ‘nutrias,’ or otters. In Paraguay, according to Azara, their Indian name
is ‘guiya.’ On the east side of the continent they range from Lat. 24° (Azara)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to the Rio Chupat in 43° 20′;—distance of 1160 miles. This latter river is 170
miles south of the Rio Negro, and the intervening space consists of level, extremely
arid, and almost desert plains, with no water, or at most one or two small
wells. As the Coypu is supposed never to leave the banks of the rivers, and
being, from its web-feet and general form of body, badly adapted for travelling
on land, its occurrence in this river is a case, like so many others in the geographical
distribution of animals, of very difficult explanation. The same remark is
indeed applicable, but with less force, to its existence in the Rio Negro. On the
west coast, it is found from the valleys of central Chile (Lat. 33) to 48° S., or
perhaps even somewhat farther, but not in Tierra del Fuego. So that, on the
Atlantic side of the continent, the plains of Patagonia check its range southward,
as, on the Pacific side, the deserts of Chile do to the north. Its range, including
both sides, is from 24° to 48°, or 1440 miles. In the Chonos Archipelago
these animals, instead of inhabiting fresh water, live exclusively in the bays and
channels which extend between the innumerable small islets of that group. They
make their burrows within the forest, a little way above the rocky beaches. I
believe it is far from being a common occurrence, that the same species of any
animal should haunt indifferently fresh water, and that of the open sea. We shall
see that the Capybara is sometimes found on the islands near the mouth of the
Plata; but these cannot be considered as their habitual station in the same
manner as the channels in the Chonos Archipelago are to the Coypu. The inhabitants
of Chiloe, who sometimes visit this Archipelago for the purpose of fishing,
state that these animals do not live solely on vegetable matter, as is the case
with those inhabiting rivers, but that they sometimes eat shell-fish. The Coypu is
said to be a bold animal, and to fight fiercely with the dogs employed in chasing
it. Its flesh when cooked is white and good to eat. An old female procured
(January) amongst these islands, weighed between ten and eleven pounds.” D.</p>

<h3 class='c013'><span class='sc'>Ctenomys Braziliensis.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>Ctenomys Braziliensis, <i>De Blainville</i>, Bulletin de la Société  Philomatique, June 1836, p. 62.</p>

<p class='c018'>Maldonado, La Plata, (<i>June</i>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>“This animal is known by the name of Tucutuco. I have given an account of
its habits in my journal, but I shall here repeat it for the sake of keeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>together my observations on the less known animals. The Tucutuco is exceedingly
abundant in the neighbourhood of Maldonado, but it is difficult to be procured,
and still more difficult to be seen, when at liberty. Azara,<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a> who has given
an account of its habits, with which every thing I saw perfectly agrees, states that
he never was able to catch more than one, although they are so extremely common.
The Tucutuco lives almost entirely under ground, and prefers a sandy soil
with a gentle inclination; but it sometimes frequents damp places, even on the
borders of lakes. The burrows are said not to be deep, but of great length.
They are seldom open; the earth being thrown up at the mouth into hillocks not
quite so large as those made by the mole. Considerable tracts of country are
completely undermined by these animals. They appear, to a certain degree, to
be gregarious; for the man who procured my specimens had caught six together,
and he said this was a common occurrence. They are nocturnal in their habits;
and their principal food is afforded by the roots of plants, which is the object of
their extensive and superficial burrows. In the stomach of one which I opened I
could only distinguish, amidst a yellowish green soft mass, a few vegetable fibres.
Azara states that they lay up magazines of food within their burrows.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Tucutuco is universally known by a very peculiar noise, which it makes
when beneath the ground. A person, the first time he hears it, is much surprised,
for it is not easy to tell whence it comes, nor is it possible to guess what kind of
creature utters it. The noise consists in a short, but not rough, nasal grunt,
which is repeated about four times in quick succession; the first grunt is not so
loud, but a little longer, and more distinct than the three following: the musical
time of the whole is constant, as often as it is uttered. The name Tucutuco is
given in imitation of the sound. In all times of the day, where this animal is
abundant, the noise may be heard, and sometimes directly beneath one’s feet.
When kept in a room, the Tucutucos move both slowly and clumsily, which
appears owing to the outward action of their hind legs; and they are likewise
quite incapable of jumping even the smallest vertical height. Mr. Reid, who
dissected a specimen which I brought home in spirits, informs me that the
socket of the thigh-bone is not attached by a ligamentum teres; and this explains,
in a satisfactory manner, the awkward movements of their hinder extremities.
Their teeth are of a bright wax yellow, and are never covered by the
lips: they are not adapted to gnaw holes or cut wood. When eating any thing,
for instance biscuit, they rested on their hind legs and held the piece in their fore
paws; they appeared also to wish to drag it into some corner. They were very
stupid in making any attempt to escape; when angry or frightened, they uttered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the Tucutuco. Of those I kept alive, several, even the first day, were quite tame,
not attempting to bite or to run away; others were a little wilder. The man who
caught them asserted that very many are invariably found blind. A specimen
which I preserved in spirits was in this state; Mr. Reid considers it to be the
effect of inflammation in the nictitating membrane. When the animal was alive,
I placed my finger within half an inch of its head, but not the slightest notice was
taken of it: it made its way, however, about the room nearly as well as the
others. Considering the subterranean habits of the Tucutuco, the blindness,
though so frequent, cannot be a very serious evil; yet it appears strange that any
animal should possess an organ constantly subject to injury. The mole, whose
habits in nearly every respect, excepting in the kind of food, are so similar, has
an extremely small and protected eye, which, although possessing a limited
vision, at once seems adapted to its manner of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Several species probably will be found to exist south of the Plata. At Bahia
Blanca (Lat. 39°) an animal burrows under ground in the same manner as the
<i>C. Braziliensis</i>, and its noise is of the same general character, but instead of
being double and repeated twice at short intervals, it is single and is uttered
either at equal intervals, or in an accelerating order. I was assured by the inhabitants
that these animals are of various colours, and, therefore, I presume that
the two kinds of noises proceeded from two species. However this may be, they
are extraordinarily numerous: many square leagues of country between the Sierras
Ventana and Guetru-heigue are so completely undermined by their burrows,
that horses in passing over the plain, sink, almost every step, fetlock deep. At
the Rio Negro (Lat. 41°) some closely allied (or same?) species utters a noise,
which is repeated only twice, instead of three or four times as with the La Plata
kind. The sound is, moreover, louder and more sonorous; and so closely resembles
that made in cutting down a small tree with an axe, that I have occasionally
remained in doubt for some time to which cause to attribute it. Where
the plains of Patagonia are very gravelly (as at Port Desire and St. Julian) the
Ctenomys, I believe, does not occur; but at Cape Negro, in the Strait of Magellan,
where the soil is damper and more sandy, the whole plain is studded with the
little hillocks, thrown up by this destructive animal. It occurs likewise south of
the Strait, on the eastern side of Tierra del Fuego, where the land is level.
Captain King brought home a specimen from the northern side of the Strait,
which Mr. Bennett<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a> has called <i>C. Magellanicus</i>: it is of a different colour from
the <i>C. Braziliensis</i>. I unfortunately did not make any note regarding the noise
of this southern species: but the circumstance of its existence rather corroborates
my belief in there being several other kinds in the neighbourhood of the Rio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Negro and Bahia Blanca. Otherwise we must believe that the same animal
utters different kinds of noises, in different districts; a fact which I should feel
much inclined to doubt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Azara<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> says that the Tucutuco may he ‘found every where; provided that
the soil be pure sand, and the situation not subject to be overflowed. As these
conditions are fulfilled only in certain spots, their warrens are far separated
from each other, even sometimes more than twenty-five leagues, without it being
possible to conceive how these animals have been able to pass from one place to
another.’ The difficulty, I think, is much overstated; for, as I have said, the
burrows of the Tucutuco are sometimes made in very damp places, near lakes;
so that they certainly might pass over almost any kind of country. But if the <i>C.
Braziliensis</i> and <i>C. Magellanicus</i> be considered as one species, as some French
authors are inclined to do, then the difficulty will be increased in a very remarkable
manner, as we shall be obliged to transport the Tucutuco over wide plains of
shingle, and across many great rivers, and an arm of the sea.”—D.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This animal is generally scarce, but in certain districts, I believe, of an
alpine character, it is abundant. It excavates very extensive superficial burrows,
no doubt, for the purpose of feeding on the roots of plants, as in the case of the
<i>Ctenomys Braziliensis</i>, the habits of which have just been described. Horses
passing over districts frequented by these animals, sink fetlock deep through the
turf. I procured my specimen from Valparaiso, where the country-people called
it ‘Cururo.’”—D.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>These little animals are exceedingly numerous in the central parts of Chile.
They frequent by hundreds the hedge-rows and thickets, where they make burrows
close together, leading one into another. They feed by day in a fearless
manner; and are very destructive to fields of young corn; when disturbed, they
all run together towards their burrows in the same manner that rabbits in England
do when feeding outside a covert. When running they carry their tails high up,
more like squirrels than rats; and they often remain seated on their haunches,
like the former animals. According to Molina<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> they lay up a store of food for
the winter, but do not become dormant. The Octodon is the “degu” of that
author: he says that the Indians in past times used to eat them with much relish.
These animals appear to be very subject to be piebald and albinos; as if partly
under the influence of domestication.</p>

<i>Poephagomys</i>, and <i>Ctenomys</i>, and on the other to the family <i>Chinchillidæ</i>.
The four genera just mentioned possess so many characters in common, that it
would be well to unite them, and the name <i>Octodontidæ</i> may be used to designate
the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>Octodontidæ</i> appear to bear the same relations to <i>Echimys</i>, as the <i>Arvicolæ</i>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>In the <i>Octodontidæ</i> the skull is rather short, the inter-orbital space is broad;
the ant-orbital passage is large; the zygomatic arch is thrown out horizontally
from the plane of the palate; the malar bone is broad and somewhat compressed,
and throws up a small post-orbital process; the glenoid cavity of the temporal
bone is narrow; the palate is contracted, and deeply notched posteriorly, the
portion which lies between the molar teeth descends below the level of the anterior
portion; the incisive foramina are wide: the body of the anterior and posterior
sphenoids is very narrow, and the foramina on either side of them are large: the
occipital condyles are very narrow, widely separated, and the articular surface
is nearly vertical.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The descending <i>ramus</i> of the lower jaw springs from the

<p class='c007'>It is not only in the comparatively small size and weakness of the fore feet
that <i>Abrocoma</i> approaches more nearly to <i>Octodon</i>; but it agrees in having the
soles, both of the fore and hind feet (which are devoid of hair), covered with minute
round fleshy tubercles (see the under side of the tarsus figured in Plate 28.)</p>

<p class='c007'>In <i>Octodon</i>, however, the toes have on their under side transverse incisions,
as the <i>Muridæ</i>, and many other Rodents; a character not found in <i>Abrocoma</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Here the underside of the toes, like the sole of the foot, is covered with minute
tubercles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though in the form of the skull <i>Abrocoma Cuvieri</i><a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> agrees most nearly with
that of <i>Octodon</i>; it differs in having the anterior portion narrower and rather
larger, compared to the part devoted to the protection of the brain; the zygomatic
arch is shorter, the incisive foramina are longer, the body of the anterior sphenoid
is narrower, and the auditory bullæ are larger. The principal differences observable
in the form of the lower jaw of <i>Abrocoma</i>, when compared with that of
<i>Octodon</i>, consists in the coronoid process being smaller, the condyloid narrower
from front to back; the descending <i>ramus</i> more deeply emarginated posteriorly,
and the angle longer and more attenuated.</p>

<p class='c007'>In those characters in which the skull of <i>Abrocoma</i> departs from that of <i>Octodon</i>,
it approaches nearer to <i>Chinchilla</i>. In the peculiar form and large size
of the ears, in the extreme softness of the fur, in the greater development of the
pads on the under side of the toes, and in the possession of only four toes to the
fore feet, there are other points of resemblance between <i>Abrocoma</i> and <i>Chinchilla</i>.
In the Chinchilla as well as in <i>Octodon</i> and <i>Abrocoma</i>, we find the toe corresponding
to the second (counting from the inner side) furnished with a broad hollow nail;<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
there are also stiff bristly hairs covering this nail as in the <i>Octodontidæ</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extreme softness of the fur of the animals about to be described, suggested
for them the generic name of <i>Abrocoma</i>. The fur consists of hairs of two
lengths, and the longer hairs are so extremely slender that they might almost be
compared to the web of the spider. The specific names applied are those of the
distinguished naturalists who first made us acquainted with the two genera, <i>Octodon</i>
and <i>Poephagomys</i>.</p>

delicate that they may almost be compared to the spiders’ thread. Both on
the upper and under side of the body the fur is deep gray at the base. The

Journal, as it is merely a corroboration of Azara’s account. According to that
author, the Bizcacha is not found north of 30°; and its southern limit occurs in the
neighbourhood of the Rio Negro in 41°. Where the plains are gravelly, it is not
abundant, but (differently from the <i>Cavia Patagonica</i>,) it prefers an argillaceous and
sandy formation, such as that near Buenos Ayres. The Bizcacha abounds over
the whole Pampas, even to the neighbourhood of Mendoza, and there it is replaced
in the Cordillera by an Alpine species. Of the latter animal, I saw one seated on
a pinnacle at a great height, but I could not obtain a specimen of it. Azara<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a> has
remarked that the Bizcacha, fortunately for the inhabitants of Banda Oriental, is
not found to the eastward of the Rio Uruguay; and what makes the case more
remarkable is, that although thus bounded by one river, it has crossed the broader
barrier of the Parana, and is numerous in the province of Entre Rios. I was
assured by a man, whose veracity I can perfectly trust, that these animals, quasi
canes, post coitum adnexi sunt.”—D.</p>

Negro it frequents in great numbers the bottoms of old hedges: at Port Desire it
lives beneath the ruins of the old Spanish buildings. One old male killed there
weighed 3530 grains. At the Strait of Magellan, I have seen amongst the Patagonian
Indians, cloaks for small children made with the skins of this little animal;
and the Jesuit Falkner says, that the people of one of the southern tribes, take their
name from the number of these animals which inhabit their country. The
Spaniards and half-civilized Indians, call the Kerodon, ‘conejos,’ or rabbit; and
thus the mistake has arisen, that rabbits are found in the neighbourhood of the

It frequents different kinds of stations,—such as hedge-rows made of the Agave

plants;—the latter appearing to be its favourite haunt. Where the soil is dry, it
makes a burrow; but where otherwise, it lives concealed amidst the herbage.
These animals generally come out to feed in the evening, and are then tame; but
if the day be gloomy, they make their appearance in the morning. They are said
to be very injurious to young trees. An old male killed at Maldonado, weighed
1 lb. 3 oz. In all the specimens I saw there, (during June, or winter,) I observed,

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Patagonia.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“This animal is found only where the country has rather a desert character.
It is a common feature in the landscape of Patagonia, to see in the distance
two or three of these Cavies hopping one after another in a straight line over the
gravelly plains, thinly clothed by a few thorny bushes and a withered herbage.
Near the coast of the Atlantic, the northern limit of this species is formed by the
Sierra Tapalguen, in latitude 37° 30′, where the plains rather suddenly become
greener and more humid. The limit certainly depends on this change, since near
Mendoza, (33° 30′.) four degrees further northward, where the country is very sterile,
this animal again occurs. Azara erroneously supposed that its northern range
was only 35°.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a> It is not clear on what circumstances its limit southward between
Ports Desire and St. Julian (about 48° 30′.) depends; for there is in that part no
change in the features of the country. It is, moreover, a singular circumstance,
that although the Cavy was not seen at Port St. Julian during our voyage, yet
Capt. Wood, in 1670, speaks of them as being numerous there. What cause can
have altered, in a wide, uninhabited, and rarely visited country, the range of an
animal like this?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Azara states,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a> that the Cavy never excavates its own burrow, but uses
that of the Bizcacha. Wherever this animal is present, without doubt this is
true; but on the sandy plains of Bahia Blanca, where the Bizcacha is not found,
the Spaniards maintain that the Cavy is its own workman. The same thing
occurs with the little owls of the Pampas (<i>Noctua cunicularia</i>), which have been
described by travellers as standing like sentinels at the mouths of almost every
burrow; for in Banda Oriental, owing to the absence of the Bizcacha, these birds
are obliged to hollow out their own habitations. Azara says, also, that this Cavy,
except when pressed by danger, does not enter its burrow; on this point I must
again differ from that high authority. At Bahia Blanca I have repeatedly seen
two or three of these animals sitting on their haunches by the mouths of their
holes, which they quietly entered as I passed by at a distance. Daily, in the
neighbourhood of these spots, the Cavies were abundant: but differently from
most burrowing animals, they wander, commonly two or three together, to miles
or leagues from their home; nor do I know whether they return at night. The
Cavy feeds and roams about by day; is shy and watchful; seldom squats after
the manner of a hare; cannot run very fast, and, therefore, is frequently caught
by a couple of dogs, even of mixed breed. Its manner of running more resembles
that of a rabbit than of a hare. The Cavy generally produces two young ones
at a birth, which are brought forth within the burrow. The flesh, when cooked, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>very white; it is, however, rather tasteless and dry. Full grown animals weigh
between twenty and twenty-six pounds.”—D.</p>

<p class='c020'>“These animals are common wherever there are large rivers or lakes, over that
part of the South American Continent which lies between the Orinoco and the Plata,
a distance of nearly 1400 miles. They are not generally supposed to extend south
of the Plata; but as there is a Laguna Carpincho (the latter being the provincial
name of the Capybara) high up the Salado, I presume they have sometimes been
seen there. Azara does not believe they ever frequent salt water; but I shot one
in the Bay of Monte Video; and several were seen by the officers of the Beagle
on the Island of Guritti, off Maldonado, where the water is very nearly as salt as
in the sea. The one I shot, at Monte Video, was an old female; it measured from
tip of snout to end of stump-like tail, 3 feet 8½ inches, and in girth 3 feet 2 inches.
She weighed 98 pounds. I opened the stomachs of a couple, which I killed near
a lake at Maldonado, and found them distended with a thin yellowish green fluid,
in which not more than a trace of a vegetable fibre could be distinguished: it is in
accordance with this fact, that a part of the œsophagus is so narrow, as I am informed
by Mr. Owen, that scarcely anything larger than a crow-quill can be passed
down it. The shape of the dung of these animals is a short straight cylinder,
rounded at the extremities; when dried and burnt, it affords a pleasant smell like
that from cedar wood. These animals do not burrow holes, but live amongst the
thickets, or beds of rushes near rivers and lakes. At Maldonado they often may
be seen during the day, seated on the grassy plain in small groups of three and
four, at the distance of a few yards from the border of the lake, which they frequent.
I must refer the reader for a few more details respecting their habits, to
my Journal of Researches.—D.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A black variety of the domesticated species, which was turned out on these
islands by the earlier colonists, has been considered, but with some hesitation, by
M. Lesson, as a distinct species. He has called it <i>Lepus Magellanicus</i>, and
has given the following specific character,—‘<i>Pilis omnino atro-violaceis, albis
passim sparsis: auriculis fuscis, capite brevioribus; maculâ albâ naso, interstitio
narium, menti, gulæ, frontique.</i>’<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a> In the specimens preserved on board the Beagle,
the form and position of the white marks neither agree with M. Lesson’s description,
nor with each other. In one there is a broad white patch on one side of the
head, and another on one of the hinder thighs. The Spaniards employed in
hunting wild cattle, (who are all excellent practical observers) assured me, that the
black rabbits were only varieties of the common gray kind, and they gave the
following reasons for thinking so;—namely, that the two sorts did not live apart;
that the black one had not a different range from the other; that the two bred
freely together, and that they produced piebald offspring. As the rabbits extend
their range very slowly, (not having yet crossed the central range,) the Spaniards
have sometimes carried a few and turned them out in different parts of the island,
and thus they have ascertained that the black and gray kinds breed together
freely. Bougainville, moreover, who visited the part of the island, where the
black variety is now most common, distinctly states, in his voyage round the
world, that no animal, excepting the great wolf-like fox inhabited these islands.
M. Lesson supposes that the <i>Lepus Magellanicus</i> is found near the Strait of Magellan;
but I inquired of the Indians, who live there, and they knew of no other
‘conejos’ or rabbits, except the <i>Kerodon Kingii</i>, which no doubt is the animal
alluded to by the early voyagers.”—D.</p>

from 26° 30′, to at least 41° south; but, I was assured, perhaps incorrectly, that
the Sierra Tapalguen (37° 30′), where the nature of the country becomes slightly
different, is its southern limit. The <i>D. villosus</i>, <i>minutus</i>, and <i>mataco</i>, are found at

likewise in the neighbourhood of the Rio Negro. This species has a range considerably
further southward than any other: I obtained specimens at Port Desire,
where, however, it is far from common, and at Santa Cruz (in latitude 50°) I saw
its tesselated covering lying on the ground. At Bahia Blanca, I found in the
stomach of this armadillo, coleoptera, larvæ, roots of plants, and even a small
snake of the genus Amphisbæna. All the species, excepting one, wander about
by day. At Bahia Blanca, during a morning’s ride, three or four of the <i>D.
minutus</i> generally were met with; but, in order to secure them, it was necessary
to jump off one’s horse as quickly as possible, otherwise, they would have disappeared
by burrowing in the sandy soil. This species often endeavours to escape

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Maldonado, La Plata, (<i>June</i>).</p>

<p class='c006'>The species described by Azara, under the name <i>Macrouré à grosse queue</i>,
agrees so perfectly with the present animal, that I have no hesitation in referring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>it to the <i>Didelphis crassicaudata</i> of Desmarest, which is founded upon Azara’s
description.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head of the <i>Didelphis crassicaudata</i> is shorter and less pointed than in most
other Opossums; the ears are unusually small, and the tail is very thick. In the
character of the fur also, this species differs from most others, the hairs being
rather short and somewhat adpressed; and the soft under fur being very scanty.
Upon separating the fur on the back and sides of the body, numerous young hairs
were visible in the specimen from which the above description is taken, and these
were of a bright rusty red tint; the colouring of the animal therefore would, in all
probability, have been very different after a short time, had it not been killed.
Those observed by Azara varied considerably in their colouring. The skull is
figured in Plate 34. figs. 25. Fig. <i>d</i> represents a <i>ramus</i> of the lower jaw.</p>

<p class='c018'>Habitat, Valparaiso, Chile, (<i>October</i>.)</p>

<p class='c006'>This little Opossum, which is the only species I am acquainted with from the
west side of the Cordillera, was exhibited at one of the scientific meetings of the
Zoological Society, and its characters were pointed out by Mr. James Reid, who
proposed for it the specific name of <i>hortensis</i>,<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a> a name which was given from the
circumstance that in Mr. Darwin’s notes it is stated that a small Opossum was
found in a garden at Maldonado. These notes however refer to the <i>Didelphis
brachyura</i>. The skull of this animal is figured in Plate 35. Fig. 5, <i>a</i>, represents
the upper side; 5, <i>b</i>, the under side; and 5, <i>c</i>, is the side view. Fig. 5, <i>d</i>, is
the lower jaw, and 5, <i>e</i>, is the same magnified. The length of the skull is 14½ lines;
width, 8 lines; length of palate, 7¼ lines; inter-orbital space, 2½ lines; length of
<i>ramus</i> of lower jaw, 10½ lines. In the palate are two long openings which commence
opposite the posterior false molar, and terminate opposite the hinder portion of the
penultimate true molar: the incisive foramina are nearly one line in length. On
the posterior portion of the palate there are four other foramina, one on each side
near the posterior molar, and one on either side the mesial line, behind the large
palatine openings above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These little animals frequent the thickets growing on the rocky hills, near
Valparaiso. They are exceedingly numerous, and are easily caught in traps
baited either with cheese or meat. The tail appeared to be scarcely at all
used as a prehensile organ; they are able to run up trees, with some degree of
facility. I could distinguish in their stomachs the larvæ of beetles.”—D.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. I am indebted to Mr. Ogilby, who visited the Prince’s collection, for a description from the specimens
of <i>C. Azaræ</i> therein preserved. In this description the tip of the tail is said to be black.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. Considering the great difference of climate and other conditions between the hot and wooded country of
Paraguay, and the desolate plains of Patagonia, one is led to suspect that the <i>Canis Azaræ</i> of La Plata and
Patagonia, which wanders about by day, and inhabits burrows instead of heaps of straw, may turn out to be a
different species from the Agouará-chay of Azara, which is nocturnal in its habits, and lives in thick coverts.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. In measuring the species of Mammalia, I almost invariably, when wishing to give the length, measure from
the tip of the nose <i>along the curve of the back</i> to the root of the tail. In the Ruminantia of course this plan is
not desirable, but in other Mammals I have found it most convenient. If we take a Cat, for instance, and
curve the body in whatever way we please, we find the length (taken in the way just mentioned) always the
same. Whereas, if we take a straight line (as many naturalists do) the length will vary according to the position
of the animal.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. I must refer the reader to my journal for some account of the habits of the jaguar and puma, which being
well known animals, and the facts that I mention having little scientific interest, I have not thought it worth
while to repeat them here.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. D’Orbigny says, (vol. ii. p. 69,) that all the species of the genus have this habit.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. Figures 47 and 48 of M. Cuvier’s work represent horns so unlike either of those brought over by Mr.
Darwin, that I cannot help suspecting they belong to some other species of stag.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. The MS. name of <i>M. decumanoïdes</i>, which I had applied to this animal, has been changed, in consequence
of my having seen a different species, with the same name attached, in the museum of the India
House.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. The great Bandicoot rat of India, (<i>Mus giganteus</i>, of Hardwicke,) ought, perhaps, to be added to the
species above enumerated; and I strongly suspect several catalogued species will prove but varieties of this
animal.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. See Proceedings of the Zoological Society for February 14th, 1837, p. 19.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. As I shall have occasion to use the terms <i>moderate</i>, <i>long</i>, <i>short</i>, <i>large</i>, &#38;c. it may be well to state that
I take the common mouse, (<i>Mus Musculus</i>,) as my standard of comparison. The ears, feet, tail, length of the
fur, general proportions, &#38;c. are in that animal what I term moderate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. A long tarsus is generally accompanied by a proportionately long tail. I presume that those Mice
which have long tarsi are in the habit of making great leaps, and that in these leaps, the tail serves to steady
and balance the body.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. In <i>Mus leucopus</i> of North America the tarsus is hairy beneath, and in the character of the teeth this
animal also agrees with the species above mentioned.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. The dimensions given in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society were taken from a younger specimen
than those here described, and there is an error in the length of the tail there given, which should be 1–10
instead of 2—10.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. In <i>Mus longipilis</i> and <i>M. brachiotis</i> may be perceived an approach to this elongated form of the muzzle.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. I am sorry to say the artist has not drawn this skull with his usual fidelity, a circumstance which I did not
perceive until it was too late to make any alteration: it is too large, and the incisors are represented as projecting
forwards too much; they are in the original so nearly at right angles with the upper surface of the skull
that but a very small portion of them is seen, when it is viewed, as represented at fig. 3, <i>a</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. It is not easy to measure the <i>width</i> of the ears in these animals: upon measuring with a thread over the
curve of the outer side I have found the width of the ears of the present animal to be as above given,—the
dimension slightly exceeding that stated in the Proceedings of the Zool. Soc.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. The tail is imperfect.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. They are naked, but I suspect the hair has been rubbed off.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. I am acquainted with seven North American Species of <i>Muridæ</i>, all of which possess the dentition of <i>Hesperomys</i>.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. I am acquainted with only one exception, and that is in the genus <i>Castor</i>. In the genus <i>Ondatra</i>, the
descending ramus is but slightly twisted outwards, but in all the other <i>Arvicolidæ</i>, whose crania I have
examined, it is remarkably so, and in the genera <i>Spalax</i> and <i>Geomys</i>, where this character is carried to the
extreme, the descending ramus projects from the alveolus of the long inferior incisors, in the form of a rounded
and almost horizontal plate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. In aged individuals of some of the species of <i>Arvicolidæ</i>, the molar teeth possess short roots. In a
skull of <i>Ondatra</i> now before me I find all the molars divided at the base into two portions, which in all probability
would have formed solid roots had the animal lived longer.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. There is a wide difference between the present animals and the <i>Arvicolidæ</i> in the form of the occipital
condyles: the same difference is also observable between <i>Echimys</i> and <i>Mus</i>. The <i>Octodontidæ</i> in fact have the
same form of condyles as the Chinchillas and Cavies. In this and many other characters the last mentioned
animals evince an affinity to the <i>Leporidæ</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. I have not had an opportunity of examining the skull of <i>Abrocoma Bennettii</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. This nail no doubt is used to cleanse the fur, and the bristly hairs may also assist in the operation; the two
small toes of the Kangaroo’s hind foot are used for the same purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
